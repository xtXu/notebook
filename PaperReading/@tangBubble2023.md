## Abstract
Autonomous exploration is a crucial aspect of robotics that has numerous applications. Most of the existing methods greedily choose goals that maximize immediate reward. This strategy is computationally efficient but insufficient for overall exploration efficiency. In recent years, some state-of-the-art methods are proposed, which generate a global coverage path and significantly improve overall exploration efficiency. However, global optimization produces high computational overhead, leading to low-frequency planner updates and inconsistent planning motion. In this work, we propose a novel method to support fast UAV exploration in large-scale and cluttered 3-D environments. We introduce a computationally low-cost viewpoints generation method using novel occlusion-free spheres. Additionally, we combine greedy strategy with global optimization, which considers both computational and exploration efficiency. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art methods to showcase its superiority in terms of exploration efficiency and computational time. We conduct various real-world experiments to demonstrate the excellent performance of our method in large-scale and cluttered environments.

## Method
### Occlusion-Free Sphere
An occlusion-free sphere is defined by its center $\mathbf{p}_{c}\in \mathbb{R}^{3}$, which lies on the target frontier, and the radius: $r=\Vert \mathrm{p}_{c}-\mathrm{p}_{o}\Vert_{2}$, where $\mathrm{p}_{o}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the nearest neighbor obstacle point (NN point).  
Since the sphere is free and convex, any segments inside the sphere is occlusion-free. By employing a viewpoint sampling strategy on the sphereâ€™s surface, no ray-casting is needed to check the visibility to the frontier cells from the viewpoints, which save the computation time.
### Viewpoints Generation
1. Incrementally search frontier cells, and down-sample to generate the set of sphere center candidates $\mathbf{C}$.
2. For each center $\mathbf{p}_{c}\in \mathbf{C}$, generate sphere $s_{i}$ and add it to a priority queue $\mathbf{S}$ sorted by sphere radius.
3. Generate a set of viewpoints to cover all candidate sphere center: Iteratively select a sphere from $\mathbf{S}$, sample viewpoints on the surface and choose the one with highest coverage, remove the frontier cells and sphere covered by the viewpoint. The iteration stops when $\mathbf{S}$ is empty.
### Global Tour Planning
1. Evaluate the gain for each viewpoints, which consider the corresponding sphere radius and the distance cost from the current pos to the viewpoint.
2. Maintain a fixed-size viewpoint priority queue $\mathbf{Q}$.
3. Plan the global path using ATSP.
### Local Trajectory Generation
**Bubble Planner**: piecewise polynomial, spherical safe flight corridor, optimization using a spatial-temporal decomposition method, receding-horizon framework.
