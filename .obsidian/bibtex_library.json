      "abstractNote": "Autonomous navigation and exploration in confined spaces are currently setting new challenges for robots. The presence of narrow passages, flammable atmosphere, dust, smoke, and other hazards makes the mapping and navigation tasks extremely difficult. To tackle these challenges, robots need to make intelligent decisions, maximising information while maintaining the safety of the system and their surroundings. In this paper, we present a suite of reasoning mechanisms along with a software architecture for exploration tasks that can be used to underpin the behavior of a broad range of robots operating in confined spaces. We present an autonomous navigation module that allows the robot to safely traverse known areas of the environment and extract features of the unknown frontier regions. An exploration component, by reasoning about these frontiers, provides the robot with the ability to venture into new spaces. From low-level sensory input and contextual information, the robot incrementally builds a semantic network that represents known and unknown parts of the environment and then uses a logic-based, high-level reasoner to interrogate such a network and decide the best course of actions. We evaluate our approach against several mine-like challenging scenarios with different characteristics using a small drone. The experimental results indicate that our method allows the robot to make informed decisions on how to best explore the environment while preserving safety.",

      "abstractNote": "A fast and simple voxel traversal algorithm through a 3D space partition is introduced.  Going from one voxel to its neighbour requires only two floating point comparisons  and one floating point addition. Also, multiple ray intersections with objects that  are in more than one voxel are eliminated.  Introduction  In recent years, ray tracing has become the algorithm of choice for generating high fidelity images. Its simplicity and elegance allows one to easily model reflection, refraction and shadows.  1  Unfortunately, it has a major drawback: computational expense. The prime reason for this is that the heart of ray tracing, intersecting an object with a ray, is expensive and can easily take up to 95% of the rendering time. Unless some sort of intersection culling is performed, each ray must intersect all the objects in the scene, a very expensive proposition.  There are two general strategies for intersection culling: hierarchical bounding volumes  1, 2, 3, 4  and space partitioning...",

      "title": "Is it Worth to Reason about Uncertainty in Occupancy Grid Maps during Path Planning?",
      "abstractNote": "This paper investigates the usefulness of reasoning about the uncertain presence of obstacles during path planning, which typically stems from the usage of probabilistic occupancy grid maps for representing the environment when mapping via a noisy sensor like a stereo camera. The traditional planning paradigm prescribes using a hard threshold on the occupancy probability to declare that a cell is an obstacle, and to plan a single path accordingly while treating unknown space as free. We compare this approach against a new uncertainty-aware planner, which plans two different path hypotheses and then merges their initial trajectory segments into a single one ending in a “next-best view” pose. After this informative view is taken, the planner commits to one of the hypotheses, or to a completely new one if a collision is imminent. Simulations were conducted comparing the proposed and traditional planner. Results show the existence of planning scenarios -like when the environment contains a dead-end, or when the goal is placed close to an obstacle- in which reasoning about uncertainty can significantly decrease the robot's traveled distance and increase the chances of reaching the goal. The new planner was also validated on a real Clearpath Jackal robot equipped with a ZED 2 stereo camera.",

      "title": "A Multi-Resolution Frontier-Based Planner for Autonomous 3D Exploration",
      "abstractNote": "In this letter we propose a planner for 3D exploration that is suitable for applications using state-of-the-art 3D sensors, such as LiDARs, that produce large point clouds with each scan. The planner is based on the detection of a frontier - a boundary between the explored and the unknown part of the environment - and consists of the algorithm for detecting frontier points, followed by the clustering of frontier points and the selection of the best frontier point to be explored. Compared to existing frontier-based approaches, the planner is more scalable, i.e., it requires less time for the same environment size while ensuring similar exploration time. The performance is achieved by relying not on data obtained directly from the 3D sensor, but on data obtained by a mapping algorithm. In order to cluster the frontier points, we exploit the properties of the Octree environment representation, which allows easy analysis with different resolutions. The planner is tested in the simulation environment and in an outdoor test area with a UAV equipped with a LiDAR sensor. The results show the advantages of the approach compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we deal with the problem of creating globally consistent pose graphs in a centralized multi-robot SLAM framework. For each robot to act autonomously, individual onboard pose estimates and maps are maintained, which are then communicated to a central server to build an optimized global map. However, inconsistencies between onboard and server estimates can occur due to onboard odometry drift or failure. Furthermore, robots do not benefit from the collaborative map if the server provides no feedback in a computationally tractable and bandwidth-efficient manner. Motivated by this challenge, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mapping framework to enable accurate global mapping among robots and server. In particular, structural differences between robot and server graphs are exploited at different spatial scales using graph spectral analysis to generate necessary constraints for the individual robot pose graphs. The proposed approach is thoroughly analyzed and validated using several real-world multi-robot field deployments where we show improvements of the onboard system up to 90%.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents a novel path planning algorithm for the autonomous exploration of unknown space using aerial robotic platforms. The proposed planner employs a receding horizon “next–best–view” scheme: In an online computed random tree it ﬁnds the best branch, the quality of which is determined by the amount of unmapped space that can be explored. Only the ﬁrst edge of this branch is executed at every planning step, while repetition of this procedure leads to complete exploration results. The proposed planner is capable of running online, onboard a robot with limited resources. Its high performance is evaluated in detailed simulation studies as well as in a challenging real world experiment using a rotorcraft micro aerial vehicle. Analysis on the computational complexity of the algorithm is provided and its good scaling properties enable the handling of large scale and complex problem setups.",

      "abstractNote": "Within this paper a new path planning algorithm for autonomous robotic exploration and inspection is presented. The proposed method plans online in a receding horizon fashion by sampling possible future configurations in a geometric random tree. The choice of the objective function enables the planning for either the exploration of unknown volume or inspection of a given surface manifold in both known and unknown volume. Application to rotorcraft Micro Aerial Vehicles is presented, although planning for other types of robotic platforms is possible, even in the absence of a boundary value solver and subject to nonholonomic constraints. Furthermore, the method allows the integration of a wide variety of sensor models. The presented analysis of computational complexity and thorough simulations-based evaluation indicate good scaling properties with respect to the scenario complexity. Feasibility and practical applicability are demonstrated in real-life experimental test cases with full on-board computation.",

      "abstractNote": "Picking a specific object from clutter is an essential component of many manipulation tasks. Partial observations often require the robot to collect additional views of the scene before attempting a grasp. This paper proposes a closed-loop next-best-view planner that drives exploration based on occluded object parts. By continuously predicting grasps from an up-to-date scene reconstruction, our policy can decide online to finalize a grasp execution or to adapt the robot's trajectory for further exploration. We show that our reactive approach decreases execution times without loss of grasp success rates compared to common camera placements and handles situations where the fixed baselines fail.

      "abstractNote": "We address the problem of autonomous exploration of unknown environments using a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) equipped with an active depth sensor. As such, the task consists in mapping the gradually discovered environment while planning the envisioned trajectories in real-time, using on-board computation only. To do so, we present SplatPlanner, an end-to-end autonomous planner that is based on a novel Permutohedral Frontier Filtering (PFF) which relies on a combination of highly efficient operations stemming from bilateral filtering using permutohedral lattices to guide the entire exploration. In particular, our PFF is computationally linear in input size, nearly parameter-free, and aggregates spatial information about frontier-neighborhoods into density scores in one single step. Comparative experiments made on simulated environments of increasing complexity show our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency, exploration speed and qualitative coverage of scenes. Finally, we also display the practical capabilities of our end-to-end system in a challenging real-flight scenario.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper describes a novel framework for autonomous exploration in large and complex environments. We show that the framework is efficient as a result of its hierarchical structure, where at one level it maintains a sparse representation of the environment and at another level, a dense representation is used within a local planning horizon around the robot. The exploration path is computed at the two levels, coarsely at the global scale and finely around the robot. Such a framework produces detailed paths in the vicinity of the robot, while trades off data resolution far away from the robot for computational efficiency. In experiments, we evaluate our method with a real robot exploring large and complex indoor and outdoor environments.

      "abstractNote": "State-of-the-art coverage planning methods perform well in simple environments but take an ineffectively long time to converge to an optimal solution in complex three-dimensional (3D) environments. As more structures are present in the same volume of workspace, these methods slow down as they spend more time searching for all of the nooks and crannies concealed in three-dimensional spaces. This work presents a method for coverage planning that employs a multi-resolution hierarchical framework to solve the problem at two different levels, producing much higher efficiency than the state-of-the-art. First, a high-level algorithm separates the environment into multiple subspaces at different resolutions and computes an order of the subspaces for traversal. Second, a low-level sampling-based algorithm solves for paths within the subspaces for detailed coverage. In experiments, we evaluate our method using real-world datasets from complex three-dimensional scenes. Our method finds paths that are constantly shorter and converges at least ten times faster than the state-of-the-art. Further, we show results of a physical experiment where a lightweight UAV follows the paths to realize the coverage.",

      "abstractNote": "We present a method for autonomous exploration in complex three-dimensional (3D) environments. Our method demonstrates exploration faster than the current state-of-the-art using a hierarchical framework – one level maintains data densely and computes a detailed path within a local planning horizon, while another level maintains data sparsely and computes a coarse path at the global scale. Such a framework shares the insight that detailed processing is most effective close to the robot, and gains computational speed by trading-off computation of details far away from the robot. The method optimizes an overall exploration path with respect to the length of the path. In addition, the path in the local area is kinodynamically feasible for the vehicle to follow at a high speed. In experiments, our systems autonomously explore indoor and outdoor environments at a high degree of complexity, with ground and aerial robots. The method produces 80% more exploration efﬁciency, deﬁned as the average explored volume per second through a run, and consumes less than 50% of computation compared to the stateof-the-art.",

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous exploration allows mobile robots to navigate in initially unknown territories in order to build complete representations of the environments. In many real-life applications, environments often contain dynamic obstacles which can compromise the exploration process by temporarily blocking passages, narrow paths, exits or entrances to other areas yet to be explored. In this work, we formulate a novel exploration strategy capable of explicitly handling dynamic obstacles, thus leading to complete and reliable exploration outcomes in populated environments. We introduce the concept of dynamic frontiers to represent unknown regions at the boundaries with dynamic obstacles together with a cost function which allows the robot to make informed decisions about when to revisit such frontiers. We evaluate the proposed strategy in challenging simulated environments and show that it outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline in these populated scenarios.",

      "abstractNote": "We propose an information-theoretic planning approach that enables mobile robots to autonomously construct dense 3D maps in a computationally efﬁcient manner. Inspired by prior work, we accomplish this task by formulating an information-theoretic objective function based on CauchySchwarz quadratic mutual information (CSQMI) that guides robots to obtain measurements in uncertain regions of the map. We then contribute a two stage approach for active mapping. First, we generate a candidate set of trajectories using a combination of global planning and generation of local motion primitives. From this set, we choose a trajectory that maximizes the information-theoretic objective. Second, we employ a gradientbased trajectory optimization technique to locally reﬁne the chosen trajectory such that the CSQMI objective is maximized while satisfying the robot’s motion constraints. We evaluated our approach through a series of simulations and experiments on a ground robot and an aerial robot mapping unknown 3D environments. Real-world experiments suggest our approach reduces the time to explore an environment by 70% compared to a closest frontier exploration strategy and 57% compared to an information-based strategy that uses global planning, while simulations demonstrate the approach extends to aerial robots with higher-dimensional state.",

      "abstractNote": "In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or `atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed “DeepLab” system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes. All of our code is made publicly available online.",

      "abstractNote": "Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task. The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with ﬁlters or pooling operations at multiple rates and multiple eﬀective ﬁelds-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Speciﬁcally, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet eﬀective decoder module to reﬁne the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, achieving the test set performance of 89% and 82.1% without any post-processing. Our paper is accompanied with a publicly available reference implementation of the proposed models in Tensorﬂow at https: //github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab.",

      "abstractNote": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown state of the art performance in high level vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. This work brings together methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level classification (also called \"semantic image segmentation\"). We show that responses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for accurate object segmentation. This is due to the very invariance properties that make DCNNs good for high level tasks. We overcome this poor localization property of deep networks by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Qualitatively, our \"DeepLab\" system is able to localize segment boundaries at a level of accuracy which is beyond previous methods. Quantitatively, our method sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 71.6% IOU accuracy in the test set. We show how these results can be obtained efficiently: Careful network re-purposing and a novel application of the 'hole' algorithm from the wavelet community allow dense computation of neural net responses at 8 frames per second on a modern GPU.",

      "title": "Rapid exploration with multi-rotors: A frontier selection method for high speed flight",
      "abstractNote": "Exploring and mapping previously unknown environments while avoiding collisions with obstacles is a fundamental task for autonomous robots. In scenarios where this needs to be done rapidly, multi-rotors are a good choice for the task, as they can cover ground at potentially very high velocities. Flying at high velocities, however, implies the ability to rapidly plan trajectories and to react to new information quickly. In this paper, we propose an extension to classical frontier-based exploration that facilitates exploration at high speeds. The extension consists of a reactive mode in which the multi-rotor rapidly selects a goal frontier from its ﬁeld of view. The goal frontier is selected in a way that minimizes the change in velocity necessary to reach it. While this approach can increase the total path length, it signiﬁcantly reduces the exploration time, since the multi-rotor can ﬂy at consistently higher speeds.",

      "abstractNote": "Exploration and collision-free navigation through an unknown environment is a fundamental task for autonomous robots. In this paper, a novel exploration strategy for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is presented. The goal of the exploration strategy is the reduction of map entropy regarding occupancy probabilities, which is reflected in a utility function to be maximised. We achieve fast and efficient exploration performance with tight integration between our octree-based occupancy mapping approach, frontier extraction, and motion planning-as a hybrid between frontier-based and sampling-based exploration methods. The computationally expensive frontier clustering employed in classic frontier-based exploration is avoided by exploiting the implicit grouping of frontier voxels in the underlying octree map representation. Candidate next-views are sampled from the map frontiers and are evaluated using a utility function combining map entropy and travel time, where the former is computed efficiently using sparse raycasting. These optimisations along with the targeted exploration of frontier-based methods result in a fast and computationally efficient exploration planner. The proposed method is evaluated using both simulated and real-world experiments, demonstrating clear advantages over state-of-the-art approaches.",

      "title": "Autonomous exploration and simultaneous object search using aerial robots",
      "abstractNote": "In this paper, a strategy for autonomous exploration of unknown environments and simultaneous object search using aerial robots is proposed. An aerial robot is initially armed with the capacity to autonomously explore unknown environments, detect objects that belong to certain semantic classes of interest and relate these detections to the respective location on the map. Provided this information, a sampling-based semantically-enhanced exploration path planning algorithm is designed such that in its every iteration it identifies a finite-depth collision free path that maximizes a gain related to exploring new space, as well as a gain related to the resolution of the observation of the previously mapped parts of the environment that relate to detected objects of interest. Through this ability to explore the unknown space, while accounting for the resolution of observation of viewpoints perceiving objects of interest, online 3D mapping that is focused on the subsets of the map most relevant with object search missions is achieved. The proposed algorithm is evaluated, verified and demonstrated in both simulation, as well as experimental studies using an autonomous aerial robot capable of GPS-denied visual-inertial localization and mapping operation.",

      "title": "Graph‐based subterranean exploration path planning using aerial and legged robots",
      "abstractNote": "Autonomous exploration of subterranean environments remains a major challenge for robotic systems. In response, this paper contributes a novel graph‐based subterranean exploration path planning method that is attuned to key topological properties of subterranean settings, such as large‐scale tunnel‐like networks and complex multibranched topologies. Designed both for aerial and legged robots, the proposed method is structured around a bifurcated local‐ and global‐planner architecture. The local planner utilizes a rapidly exploring random graph to reliably and efficiently identify paths that optimize an exploration gain within a local subspace, while simultaneously avoiding obstacles, respecting applicable traversability constraints and honoring dynamic limitations of the robots. Reflecting the fact that multibranched and tunnel‐like networks of underground environments can often lead to dead‐ends and accounting for the robot endurance, the global planning layer works in conjunction with the local planner to incrementally build a sparse global graph and is engaged when the system must be repositioned to a previously identified frontier of the exploration space, or commanded to return‐to‐home. The designed planner is detailed with respect to its computational complexity and compared against state‐of‐the‐art approaches. Emphasizing field experimentation, the method is evaluated within multiple real‐life deployments using aerial robots and the ANYmal legged system inside both long‐wall and room‐and‐pillar underground mines in the United States and in Switzerland, as well as inside an underground bunker. The presented results further include missions conducted within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Subterranean Challenge, a relevant competition on underground exploration.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents a novel strategy for autonomous graph-based exploration path planning in subterranean environments. Attuned to the fact that subterranean settings, such as underground mines, are often large-scale networks of narrow tunnel-like and multi-branched topologies, the proposed planner is structured around a bifurcated local-and global-planner architecture. The local planner employs a rapidly-exploring random graph to reliably and efficiently identify collision-free paths that optimize an exploration gain within a local subspace. Accounting for the robot endurance limitations and the possibility that the local planner reaches a dead-end (e.g. a mine heading), the global planner is engaged when a return-to-home path must be derived or when the robot should be re-positioned towards an edge of the exploration space. The proposed planner is field evaluated in a collection of deployments inside both active and abandoned underground mines in the U.S. and in Switzerland.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents a novel strategy for autonomous visual saliency–aware receding horizon exploration of unknown environments using aerial robots. Through a model of visual attention, incrementally built maps are annotated regarding the visual importance and saliency of different objects and entities in the environment. Provided this information, a path planner that simultaneously optimizes for exploration of unknown space, and also directs the robot’s attention to focus on the most salient objects, is developed. Following a two–step optimization paradigm, the algorithm ﬁrst samples a random tree and identiﬁes the branch maximizing for new volume to be explored. The ﬁrst viewpoint of this path is then provided as a reference to the second planning step. Within that, a new tree is spanned, admissible branches arriving at the reference viewpoint while respecting a time budget dependent on the robot endurance and its environment exploration rate are found and evaluated in terms of reobserving salient regions at sufﬁcient resolution. The best branch is then selected and executed by the robot, and the whole process is iteratively repeated. The proposed method is evaluated regarding its ability to provide increased attention toward salient objects, is veriﬁed to run onboard a small aerial robot, and is demonstrated in a set of challenging experimental studies.",

      "title": "Prioritized Indoor Exploration with a Dynamic Deadline",
      "abstractNote": "Indoor exploration using mobile robots has typically focused on exploring the entire environment without considering deadlines. This paper introduces a priority-based exploration algorithm for situations with an initially unknown and dynamically assigned deadline. The goal of our exploration strategy is to determine the geometric structure of an unknown environment as rapidly as possible and return to the home location. This is necessary for dangerous environments where an initial rapid robot exploration provides critical information about the layout for subsequent operations. For example, firefighters, for whom time is of the essence, can utilize the map generated by this robotic exploration to navigate a building on fire. We present a three-part strategy to solve this problem. First, we represent the physical environment as an exploration graph, whose vertices represent the local environment with its geometric and semantic information. Second, we assign priority values to these vertices based on their environment regions. Third, we present a graph exploration algorithm that employs the vertex priorities. Simulation experiments on a set of graph environments and Gazebo environments demonstrate that, in contrast to prior approaches that ignore the semantic information, our priority-based exploration algorithm enables the robot to efficiently explore more of the environment while satisfying its deadline constraints.",

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous mobile robots perform many tasks, such as grasping and inspection, that may require complete models of three-dimensional (3-D) objects in the environment. If little or no knowledge about an object is known a priori, the robot must take sensor measurements from strategically determined viewpoints in order to reconstruct a 3-D model of the object. We propose an autonomous object reconstruction approach for mobile robots that is very general, with no assumptions about object shape or size, such as a bounding box or predetermined set of candidate viewpoints. A probabilistic, volumetric method for determining the optimal next-best view is developed based on a partial model of a 3-D object of unknown shape and size. The proposed method integrates an object probability characteristic to determine sensor views that incrementally reconstruct a 3-D model of the object. Experiments in simulation and on a real-world robot validate the work and compare it to the state of the art.",

      "abstractNote": "In this work we propose a holistic framework for autonomous aerial inspection tasks, using semantically-aware, yet, computationally efficient planning and mapping algorithms. The system leverages state-of-the-art receding horizon exploration techniques for next-best-view (NBV) planning with geometric and semantic segmentation information provided by state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), with the goal of enriching environment representations. The contributions of this article are threefold, first we propose an efficient sensor observation model, and a reward function that encodes the expected information gains from the observations taken from specific view points. Second, we extend the reward function to incorporate not only geometric but also semantic probabilistic information, provided by a DCNN for semantic segmentation that operates in real-time. The incorporation of semantic information in the environment representation allows biasing exploration towards specific objects, while ignoring task-irrelevant ones during planning. Finally, we employ our approaches in an autonomous drone shipyard inspection task. A set of simulations in realistic scenarios demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed framework when compared with the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstractNote": "At the heart of path-planning methods for autonomous robotic exploration is a heuristic which encourages exploring unknown regions of the environment. Such heuristics are typically computed using frontier-based or informationtheoretic methods. Frontier-based methods deﬁne the information gain of an exploration path as the number of boundary cells, or frontiers, which are visible from the path. However, the discrete and non-differentiable nature of this measure of information gain makes it difﬁcult to optimize using gradientbased methods. In contrast, information-theoretic methods deﬁne information gain as the mutual information between the sensor’s measurements and the explored map. However, computation of the gradient of mutual information involves ﬁnite differencing and is thus computationally expensive. In this work, we propose an exploration planning framework which combines sampling-based path planning and gradient-based path optimization. The main contribution of this framework is a novel reformulation of information gain as a differentiable function. This allows us to simultaneously optimize information gain with other differentiable quality measures, such as smoothness. The effectiveness of the proposed planning framework is veriﬁed both in simulation and in hardware experiments using a Turtlebot3 Burger robot.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents a novel path planning strategy for fast and agile exploration using aerial robots. Tailored to the combined need for large-scale exploration of challenging and confined environments, despite the limited endurance of micro aerial vehicles, the proposed planner employs motion primitives to identify admissible paths that search the configuration space, while exploiting the dynamic flight properties of small aerial robots. Utilizing a computationally efficient volumetric representation of the environment, the planner provides fast collision-free and future-safe paths that maximize the expected exploration gain and ensure continuous fast navigation through the unknown environment. The new method is field-verified in a set of deployments relating to subterranean exploration and specifically, in both modern and abandoned underground mines in Northern Nevada utilizing a 0.55m-wide collision-tolerant flying robot exploring with a speed of up to 2m/s and navigating sections with width as small as 0.8m.",

Exploring and modelling the environment required planning of best view positions as well as a navigation strategy that assure completeness and high quality of the construed model. In this paper, we describe a next-best-view planning for a mobile robot with limited sensors capability to explore and construct a 3D model of an indoor environment. Starting with a 2D occupancy grid map, the proposed algorithm shall process this map and generate candidates view poses. Next, the algorithm shall select the set of best views and generate a navigation plan of RGB-D sensor poses while satisfying a set of constrains in order to maximize the quality of the 3D constructed model and coverage of the indoor environment. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and validity of the proposed system.",

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous UAV path planning for 3D reconstruction has been actively studied in various applications for high-quality 3D models. However, most existing works have adopted explore-then-exploit, prior-based or exploration-based strategies, demonstrating inefficiency with repeated flight and low autonomy. In this paper, we propose PredRecon, a prediction-boosted planning framework that can autonomously generate paths for high 3D reconstruction quality. We obtain inspiration from humans can roughly infer the complete construction structure from partial observation. Hence, we devise a surface prediction module (SPM) to predict the coarse complete surfaces of the target from the current partial reconstruction. Then, the uncovered surfaces are produced by online volumetric mapping waiting for observation by UAV. Lastly, a hierarchical planner plans motions for 3D reconstruction, which sequentially finds efficient global coverage paths, plans local paths for maximizing the performance of Multi-View Stereo (MVS), and generates smooth trajectories for image-pose pairs acquisition. We conduct benchmarks in the realistic simulator, which validates the performance of PredRecon compared with the classical and state-of-the-art methods.

      "title": "CPC: Complementary Progress Constraints for Time-Optimal Quadrotor Trajectories",
      "abstractNote": "In many mobile robotics scenarios, such as drone racing, the goal is to generate a trajectory that passes through multiple waypoints in minimal time. This problem is referred to as time-optimal planning. State-of-the-art approaches either use polynomial trajectory formulations, which are suboptimal due to their smoothness, or numerical optimization, which requires waypoints to be allocated as costs or constraints to speciﬁc discretetime nodes. For time-optimal planning, this time-allocation is a priori unknown and renders traditional approaches incapable of producing truly time-optimal trajectories. We introduce a novel formulation of progress bound to waypoints by a complementarity constraint. While the progress variables indicate the completion of a waypoint, change of this progress is only allowed in local proximity to the waypoint via complementarity constraints. This enables the simultaneous optimization of the trajectory and the time-allocation of the waypoints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst approach allowing for truly timeoptimal trajectory planning for quadrotors and other systems. We perform and discuss evaluations on optimality and convexity, compare to other related approaches, and qualitatively to an expert-human baseline.",

      "abstractNote": "Semantic segmentation networks are usually pre-trained once and not updated during deployment. As a consequence, misclassifications commonly occur if the distribution of the training data deviates from the one encountered during the robot's operation. We propose to mitigate this problem by adapting the neural network to the robot's environment during deployment, without any need for external supervision. Leveraging complementary data representations, we generate a supervision signal, by probabilistically accumulating consecutive 2D semantic predictions in a volumetric 3D map. We then train the network on renderings of the accumulated semantic map, effectively resolving ambiguities and enforcing multi-view consistency through the 3D representation. In contrast to scene adaptation methods, we aim to retain the previously-learned knowledge, and therefore employ a continual learning experience replay strategy to adapt the network. Through extensive experimental evaluation, we show successful adaptation to real-world indoor scenes both on the ScanNet dataset and on in-house data recorded with an RGB-D sensor. Our method increases the segmentation accuracy on average by 9.9% compared to the fixed pre-trained neural network, while retaining knowledge from the pre-training dataset.",

After reading this chapter, the reader will have a ready to use MAV simulator, including control and state estimation. The simulator was designed in a modular way, such that different controllers and state estimators can be used interchangeably, while incorporating new MAVs is reduced to a few steps. The provided controllers can be adapted to a custom vehicle by only changing a parameter ﬁle. Different controllers and state estimators can be compared with the provided evaluation framework. The simulation framework is a good starting point to tackle higher level tasks, such as collision avoidance, path planning, and vision based problems, like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), on MAVs. All components were designed to be analogous to its real world counterparts. This allows the usage of the same controllers and state estimators, including their parameters, in the simulation as on the real MAV.",

      "abstractNote": "In this article, we propose a complete and robust system for the aggressive ﬂight of autonomous quadrotors. The proposed system is built upon on the classical teach-and-repeat framework, which is widely adopted in infrastructure inspection, aerial transportation, and search-and-rescue. For these applications, a human’s intention is essential for deciding the topological structure of the ﬂight trajectory of the drone. However, poor teaching trajectories and changing environments prevent a simple teach-and-repeat system from being applied ﬂexibly and robustly. In this article, instead of commanding the drone to precisely follow a teaching trajectory, we propose a method to automatically convert a human-piloted trajectory, which can be arbitrarily jerky, to a topologically equivalent one. The generated trajectory is guaranteed to be smooth, safe, and dynamically feasible, with a human preferable aggressiveness. Also, to avoid unmapped or moving obstacles during ﬂights, a fast local perception method and a sliding-windowed replanning method are integrated into our system, to generate safe and dynamically feasible local trajectories onboard. We name our system as teach–repeat–replan. It can capture users’ intention of a ﬂight mission, convert an arbitrarily jerky teaching path to a smooth repeating trajectory, and generate safe local replans to avoid unexpected collisions. The proposed planning system is integrated into a complete autonomous quadrotor with global and local perception and localization submodules. Our system is validated by performing aggressive ﬂights in challenging indoor/outdoor environments. We release all components in our quadrotor system as open-source ros packages.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents a new sensor based global path planner which operates in two steps. In the first step the safest areas in the environment are extracted by means of a Voronoi diagram. In the second step fast marching method is applied to the Voronoi extracted areas in order to obtain the shortest path. In this way the trajectory obtained is the shortest between the safe possible ones. This two step method combines an extremely fast global planner operating on a simple sensor based environment modeling, while it operates at the sensor frequency. The main characteristics are speed and reliability, because the map dimensions are reduced to a unidimensional map and this map represents the safest areas in the environment for moving the robot",

      "abstractNote": "The ability to safely navigate through complex and cluttered environments is required for a wide range of robotics applications. This paper introduces a framework to compute safe global paths in maps represented as collections of 3D Signed Distance Function (SDF) submaps. Such maps are able to maintain global consistency in spite of odometry drift. However, computationally efficient global path planning in this context remains a challenging problem. We present a planning approach based on pre-computed local graphs, computed in each submap, that are linked to form a global path at planning time. To ensure globally safe paths, planning algorithms make frequent queries to the submap collection, which grows over time as the agent collects observational data. We present an efficient algorithm for performing these queries, through the use of a spatial hash table. We analyze the performance of our proposal extensively in simulation and real-world environments, and compare our approach to state- of-the-art planning approaches designed for monolithic maps, extended to submap-based maps. We show the efficacy of our method at adapting to global map deformations, while significantly reducing the planning time to an average of 1.2 seconds, a reduction by 90 % compared to classical monolithic approaches.",

      "abstractNote": "Robots require a detailed understanding of the 3D structure of the environment for autonomous navigation and path planning. A popular approach is to represent the environment using metric, dense 3D maps such as 3D occupancy grids. However, in large environments the computational power required for most state-of-the-art 3D dense mapping systems is compromising precision and real-time capability. In this work, we propose a novel mapping method that is able to build and maintain 3D dense representations for large indoor environments using standard CPUs. Topological global representations and 3D dense submaps are maintained as hybrid global map. Submaps are generated for every new visited place. A place (room) is identified as an isolated part of the environment connected to other parts through transit areas (doors). This semantic partitioning of the environment allows for a more efficient mapping and path-planning. We also propose a method for autonomous exploration that directly builds the hybrid representation in real time.We validate the real-time performance of our hybrid system on simulated and real environments regarding mapping and path-planning. The improvement in execution time and memory requirements upholds the contribution of the proposed work.",

      "title": "SegNeXt: Rethinking Convolutional Attention Design for Semantic Segmentation",
      "abstractNote": "We present SegNeXt, a simple convolutional network architecture for semantic segmentation. Recent transformer-based models have dominated the field of semantic segmentation due to the efficiency of self-attention in encoding spatial information. In this paper, we show that convolutional attention is a more efficient and effective way to encode contextual information than the self-attention mechanism in transformers. By re-examining the characteristics owned by successful segmentation models, we discover several key components leading to the performance improvement of segmentation models. This motivates us to design a novel convolutional attention network that uses cheap convolutional operations. Without bells and whistles, our SegNeXt significantly improves the performance of previous state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmarks, including ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff, Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, and iSAID. Notably, SegNeXt outperforms EfficientNet-L2 w/ NAS-FPN and achieves 90.6% mIoU on the Pascal VOC 2012 test leaderboard using only 1/10 parameters of it. On average, SegNeXt achieves about 2.0% mIoU improvements compared to the state-of-the-art methods on the ADE20K datasets with the same or fewer computations.

      "abstractNote": "Pathﬁnding in uniform-cost grid environments is a problem commonly found in application areas such as robotics and video games. The state-of-the-art is dominated by hierarchical pathﬁnding algorithms which are fast and have small memory overheads but usually return suboptimal paths. In this paper we present a novel search strategy, speciﬁc to grids, which is fast, optimal and requires no memory overhead. Our algorithm can be described as a macro operator which identiﬁes and selectively expands only certain nodes in a grid map which we call jump points. Intermediate nodes on a path connecting two jump points are never expanded. We prove that this approach always computes optimal solutions and then undertake a thorough empirical analysis, comparing our method with related works from the literature. We ﬁnd that searching with jump points can speed up A* by an order of magnitude and more and report signiﬁcant improvement over the current state of the art.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we propose a novel cluster-based Next-Best-View path planning algorithm to simultaneously explore and inspect large-scale unknown environments with multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In the majority of existing informative path-planning methods, a volumetric criterion is used for the exploration of unknown areas, and the presence of surfaces is only taken into account indirectly. Unfortunately, this approach may lead to inaccurate 3D models, with no guarantee of global surface coverage. To perform accurate 3D reconstructions and minimize runtime, we extend our previous online planner based on TSDF (Truncated Signed Distance Function) mapping, to a fleet of UAVs. Sensor configurations to be visited are directly extracted from the map and assigned greedily to the aerial vehicles, in order to maximize the global utility at the fleet level. The performances of the proposed TSGA (TSP-Greedy Allocation) planner and of a nearest neighbor planner have been compared via realistic numerical experiments in two challenging environments (a power plant and the Statue of Liberty) with up to five quadrotor UAVs equipped with stereo cameras.",

      "abstractNote": "Lightweight and semantically meaningful environment maps are crucial for many applications in robotics and autonomous driving to facilitate higher-level tasks such as navigation and planning. In this paper we present a novel approach to incrementally build a meaningful and lightweight semantic map directly as a 3D mesh from a monocular or stereo sequence. Our system leverages existing feature-based visual odometry paired with learned depth prediction and semantic image segmentation to identify and reconstruct semantically relevant environment structure. We introduce a probabilistic fusion scheme to incrementally refine and extend a 3D mesh with semantic labels for each face without intermediate voxel-based fusion. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate our system in outdoor driving scenarios with monocular depth prediction and stereo and present quantitative and qualitative reconstruction results with comparison to ground truth. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves reconstruction quality comparable to current state-of-the-art voxel-based methods while being much more lightweight both in storage and computation.",

      "abstractNote": "Three-dimensional models provide a volumetric representation of space which is important for a variety of robotic applications including flying robots and robots that are equipped with manipulators. In this paper, we present an open-source framework to generate volumetric 3D environment models. Our mapping approach is based on octrees and uses probabilistic occupancy estimation. It explicitly represents not only occupied space, but also free and unknown areas. Furthermore, we propose an octree map compression method that keeps the 3D models compact. Our framework is available as an open-source C++ library and has already been successfully applied in several robotics projects. We present a series of experimental results carried out with real robots and on publicly available real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to update the representation efficiently and models the data consistently while keeping the memory requirement at a minimum.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we propose a model-free volumetric Next Best View (NBV) algorithm for accurate 3D reconstruction using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for high-mix-low-volume objects in manufacturing. The volumetric information gain based Next Best View algorithm can in real-time select the next optimal view that reveals the maximum uncertainty of the scanning environment with respect to a partially reconstructed 3D Occupancy map, without any priori knowledge of the target. Traditional Occupancy grid maps make two independence assumptions for computational tractability but suffer from the overconfident estimation of the occupancy probability for each voxel leading to less precise surface reconstructions. This paper proposes a special case of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the Gibbs sampler, to accurately estimate the posterior occupancy probability of a voxel by randomly sampling from its high-dimensional full posterior occupancy probability given the entire volumetric map with respect to the forward sensor model with a Gaussian distribution. Numerical experiments validate the performance of the MCMC Gibbs sampler algorithm under the ROS-Industry framework to prove the accuracy of the reconstructed Occupancy map and the completeness of the registered point cloud. The proposed MCMC Occupancy mapping could be used to optimise the tuning parameters of the online NBV algorithms via the inverse sensor model to realise industry automation.",

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous exploration in large-scale and complex environments is a challenging task. As the size of the environment increases, the significant overhead of exploration algorithms could overwhelm the computational capability of mobile platforms, prohibiting timely response to environmental changes. Meanwhile, the quality of exploration paths becomes increasingly important in larger scenes, as poorly selected paths greatly reduce efficiency. In this letter, a systematic framework is proposed to explore large-scale unknown environments. To enable high-frequency planning, a fast preprocessing of environmental information is presented, providing fundamental information to support high-frequency path planning. An path optimization formulation that comprehensively considers key factors about fast exploration is introduced. Further, an heuristic algorithm is devised to solve the NP-hard optimization problem, which empirically finds optimal solution in real time. Simulation results show the run time of our method is significantly shorter than existing ones. Our method completes exploration with the least time and shortest movement distance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstractNote": "In this article, recently proposed control methods, suitable for trajectory tracking in fully actuated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are reviewed and experimentally compared. We speciﬁcally focus on multirotor platforms with tiltable propellers, for which the thrust and torque delivered by each rotor can be oriented within the aircraft frame using servo actuators. First, the main assumptions underlying the control design model usually employed in the literature are discussed, pointing out the main limitations. Then, some recent control laws that have been proposed to address the trajectory tracking problem for these platforms are reviewed, placing emphasis on their tracking capabilities as well as on the ease of tuning and implementation. Finally, experimental results obtained by applying three control laws on a tilt-arm quadrotor UAV are shown to evaluate and compare their performance. Two experiments, representative of operating conditions for thrust-vectoring UAVs, have been performed: a set-point tracking with level attitude and a fullpose trajectory tracking task.",

      "abstractNote": "We consider the problem of next-best view selection for volumetric reconstruction of an object by a mobile robot equipped with a camera. Based on a probabilistic volumetric map that is built in real time, the robot can quantify the expected information gain from a set of discrete candidate views. We propose and evaluate several formulations to quantify this information gain for the volumetric reconstruction task, including visibility likelihood and the likelihood of seeing new parts of the object. These metrics are combined with the cost of robot movement in utility functions. The next best view is selected by optimizing these functions, aiming to maximize the likelihood of discovering new parts of the object. We evaluate the functions with simulated and real world experiments within a modular software system that is adaptable to other robotic platforms and reconstruction problems. We release our implementation open source.",

      "title": "Fast Marching Tree: a Fast Marching Sampling-Based Method for Optimal Motion Planning in Many Dimensions",
      "abstractNote": "In this paper we present a novel probabilistic sampling-based motion planning algorithm called the Fast Marching Tree algorithm (FMT*). The algorithm is specifically aimed at solving complex motion planning problems in high-dimensional configuration spaces. This algorithm is proven to be asymptotically optimal and is shown to converge to an optimal solution faster than its state-of-the-art counterparts, chiefly PRM* and RRT*. The FMT* algorithm performs a “lazy” dynamic programming recursion on a predetermined number of probabilistically-drawn samples to grow a tree of paths, which moves steadily outward in cost-to-arrive space. As such, this algorithm combines features of both single-query algorithms (chiefly RRT) and multiple-query algorithms (chiefly PRM), and is reminiscent of the Fast Marching Method for the solution of Eikonal equations. As a departure from previous analysis approaches that are based on the notion of almost sure convergence, the FMT* algorithm is analyzed under the notion of convergence in probability: the extra mathematical flexibility of this approach allows for convergence rate bounds—the first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning. Specifically, for a certain selection of tuning parameters and configuration spaces, we obtain a convergence rate bound of order O(n−1/d+ρ), where n is the number of sampled points, d is the dimension of the configuration space, and ρ is an arbitrarily small constant. We go on to demonstrate asymptotic optimality for a number of variations on FMT*, namely when the configuration space is sampled non-uniformly, when the cost is not arc length, and when connections are made based on the number of nearest neighbors instead of a fixed connection radius. Numerical experiments over a range of dimensions and obstacle configurations confirm our the-oretical and heuristic arguments by showing that FMT*, for a given execution time, returns substantially better solutions than either PRM* or RRT*, especially in high-dimensional configuration spaces and in scenarios where collision-checking is expensive.",

An additional advantage of $$\\text {FMT}^*$$FMT∗is that it builds and maintains paths in a tree-like structure (especially useful for planning under differential constraints). The $$\\text {FMT}^*$$FMT∗algorithm essentially performs a “lazy” dynamic programming recursion on a set of probabilistically-drawn samples to grow a tree of paths, which moves steadily outward in cost-to-come space. As such, this algorithm combines features of both single-query algorithms (chiefly RRT) and multiple-query algorithms (chiefly PRM), and is conceptually related to the Fast Marching Method for the solution of eikonal equations. As a departure from previous analysis approaches that are based on the notion of almost sure convergence, the $$\\text {FMT}^*$$FMT∗algorithm is analyzed under the notion of convergence in probability: the extra mathematical flexibility of this approach allows for significant algorithmic advantages and provides convergence rate bounds—a first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning. Numerical experiments over a range of dimensions and obstacle configurations confirm our theoretical and heuristic arguments by showing that FMT$$^*$$∗, for a given execution time, returns substantially better solutions than either PRM$$^*$$∗or RRT$$^*$$∗, especially in high-dimensional configuration spaces and in scenarios where collision checking is expensive.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for planning exploration paths to generate 3D models of unknown environments by using a micro-aerial vehicle (MAV). Our algorithm initially determines a next-best-view (NBV) that maximizes information gain and plans a collision-free path to reach the NBV. Along the path, the MAV explores the greatest unknown area although it sometimes misses minor unreconstructed region, such as a hole or a sparse surface. To cover such a region, we propose an online inspection algorithm that consistently provides an optimal coverage path toward the NBV in real time. The algorithm iteratively reﬁnes an inspection path according to the acquired information until the modeling of a speciﬁc local area is complete. We evaluated the proposed algorithm by comparing it with other state-of-the-art approaches through simulated experiments. The results show that our algorithm outperforms the other approaches in both exploration and 3D modeling scenarios.",

      "abstractNote": "To date, a large number of algorithms to solve the problem of autonomous exploration and mapping has been presented. However, few efforts have been made to compare these techniques. In this paper, an extensive study of the most important methods for autonomous exploration and mapping of unknown environments is presented. Furthermore, a representative subset of these techniques has been chosen to be analysed. This subset contains methods that differ in the level of multi-robot coordination and in the grade of integration with the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. These exploration techniques were tested in simulation and compared using different criteria as exploration time or map quality. The results of this analysis are shown in this paper. The weaknesses and strengths of each strategy have been stated and the most appropriate algorithm for each application has been determined.",

      "abstractNote": "During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.",

      "abstractNote": "To capture the geometry of an object by an autonomous system, next best view (NBV) planning can be used to determine the path a robot will take. However, current NBV planning algorithms do not distinguish between objects that need to be mapped and everything else in the environment; leading to inefficient search strategies. In this paper we present a novel approach for NBV planning that accounts for the importance of objects in the environment to inform navigation. Using weighted entropy to encode object utilities computed via semantic segmentation, we evaluate our approach over a set of virtual Gazebo environments comparable to construction scales. Our results show that using semantic information reduces the time required to capture a target object by at least 40 percent.",

      "abstractNote": "As vision-based navigation of small aircraft has been demonstrated to reach relative maturity, research into effective path-planning algorithms to complete the loop of autonomous navigation has been booming. Although the literature has seen some impressive works in this area, efficient path-planning that can be used in tasks such as inspection and coverage is still an open problem. In this spirit, this letter presents an online path-planning algorithm for fast exploration and 3D reconstruction of a previously unknown area of interest. Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are an ideal candidate for this task due to their maneuverability, but their limited computational power and endurance require efficient planning strategies. Popular sampling-based methods randomly sample the MAV's configuration space and evaluate viewpoints according to their expected information gain. Most often, however, valuable resources are spent on information gain calculations of unpromising viewpoints. This letter proposes a novel informed sampling approach that leverages surface frontiers to sample viewpoints only where high information gain is expected, leading to faster exploration. We study the impact of informed sampling in a wide range of photo-realistic scenes, and we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art exploration path planners in terms of both speed and reconstruction quality.",

      "abstractNote": "The procedure of manually generating a 3D model of an object is very time consuming for a human operator. Next best-view (NBV) planning is an important aspect for automation of this procedure in a robotic environment. We propose a surface-based NBV approach, which creates a triangle surface from a real-time data stream and determines viewpoints similar to human intuition. Thereby, the boundaries in the surface are detected and a quadratic patch for each boundary is estimated. Then several viewpoint candidates are calculated, which look perpendicular to the surface and overlap with previous sensor data. A NBV is selected with the goal to fill areas which are occluded. This approach focuses on the completion of a 3D model of an unknown object. Thereby, the search space for the viewpoints is not restricted to a cylinder or sphere. Our NBV determination proves to be very fast, and is evaluated in an experiment on test objects, applying an industrial robot and a laser range scanner.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents a novel strategy for autonomous teamed exploration of subterranean environments using legged and aerial robots. Tailored to the fact that subterranean settings, such as cave networks and underground mines, often involve complex, large-scale and multi-branched topologies, while wireless communication within them can be particularly challenging, this work is structured around the synergy of an onboard exploration path planner that allows for resilient long-term autonomy, and a multi-robot coordination framework. The onboard path planner is unified across legged and flying robots and enables navigation in environments with steep slopes, and diverse geometries. When a communication link is available, each robot of the team shares submaps to a centralized location where a multi-robot coordination framework identifies global frontiers of the exploration space to inform each system about where it should re-position to best continue its mission. The strategy is verified through a field deployment inside an underground mine in Switzerland using a legged and a flying robot collectively exploring for 45 min, as well as a longer simulation study with three systems.",

We hypothesized that it would be possible to plan and robustly execute trajectories in obstacle-dense environments using the novel Iterative Regional Inﬂation by Semideﬁnite programming algorithm (IRIS), mixed-integer semideﬁnite programs (MISDP), and model-based control. Unlike sampling-based approaches, the planning algorithm ﬁrst introduced by Deits theoretically guarantees non-penetration of the trajectories even with small obstacles such as strings. We present experimental validation of this claim by aggressively ﬂying a small quadrotor (34g, 92mm rotor to rotor) in a series of indoor environments including a cubic meter volume containing 20 interwoven strings, and present the control architecture we developed to do so.",

      "abstractNote": "We introduce the concept of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) as a randomized data structure that is designed for a broad class of path planning problems. While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.",

      "title": "Complex Semantic-Spatial Relation Aided Indoor Target-Directed Exploration",
      "abstractNote": "This paper addresses the problem of target-directed exploration (TDE) in initially unknown and large-scale indoor environments. In such scenarios, the inference on an unknown space can improve the search performance under the assumption that the context of a particular space (i.e., the functional category of the space) is correlated with the existence of a target. The space inference is promising in that there is a strong statistical correlation between the semantic categories of indoor spaces and their adjacency because the spaces are designed to reflect universal human preferences. In this point of view, we propose a novel TDE scheme leveraging the semantic-spatial relations of an indoor floorplan dataset. Whereas existing works dealing with the data-driven space inferences consider only the one-to-one relation statistics of the spaces or utilize heuristic counting-based matching algorithms without building a trainable latent model, we propose the pattern cognitive Multivariate Bernoulli Distribution-based Graphical Space Inference Model (MBD-GSIM). MBD-GSIM efficiently captures the core contexts of the discrete semantic-spatial relations to predict an unknown space by using the latent Multivariate Bernoulli Distribution model. We also suggest utilizing the MBD-GSIM in a cost-utility based frontier exploration scheme for TDE problems. The proposed scheme is constructed in the Robot Operating System (ROS); its efficiency is investigated in the Gazebo simulation environment.",

      "abstractNote": "Exploring an unknown environment without colliding with obstacles is one of the essentials of autonomous vehicles to perform diverse missions such as structural inspections, rescues, deliveries, and so forth. Therefore, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS), which are fast, agile, and have high degrees of freedom, have been widely used. However, previous approaches have two limitations: a) First, they may not be appropriate for exploring large-scale environments because they mainly depend on random sampling-based path planning that causes unnecessary movements. b) Second, they assume the pose estimation is accurate enough, which is the most critical factor in obtaining an accurate map. In this paper, to explore and map unknown large-scale environments rapidly and accurately, we propose a novel exploration method that combines the pre-calculated Peacock Trajectory with graph-based global exploration and active loop-closing. Because the two-step trajectory that considers the kinodynamics of UAVs is used, obstacle avoidance is guaranteed in the receding-horizon manner. In addition, local exploration that considers the frontier and global exploration based on the graph maximizes the speed of exploration by minimizing unnecessary revisiting. In addition, by actively closing the loop based on the likelihood, pose estimation performance is improved. The proposed method’s performance is verified by exploring 3D simulation environments in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the proposed approach is validated in a real-world experiment.",

      "abstractNote": "To achieve scenario intelligence, humans must transfer knowledge to robots by developing goal-oriented algorithms, which are sometimes insensitive to dynamically changing environments. While deep reinforcement learning achieves significant success recently, the long and difficult training process limits its application. In this paper, we propose a hybrid structure named Option-Interruption in which human knowledge is embedded into a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. Our architecture has two key components: options, represented by existing human-designed methods, can significantly speed up the training process and interruption mechanism, based on learnable termination functions, enables our system to timely terminate the current option according to the external environment. To implement this architecture, we derive a set of update rules based on policy gradient methods and present a complete training process. In the experiment part, our method is evaluated in two simulated tasks, Four-room navigation and exploration task, which shows the efficiency and flexibility of our framework.",

      "abstractNote": "We present a novel 3D mapping method leveraging the recent progress in neural implicit representation for 3D reconstruction. Most existing state-of-the-art neural implicit representation methods are limited to object-level reconstructions and can not incrementally perform updates given new data. In this work, we propose a fusion strategy and training pipeline to incrementally build and update neural implicit representations that enable the reconstruction of large scenes from sequential partial observations. By representing an arbitrarily sized scene as a grid of latent codes and performing updates directly in latent space, we show that incrementally built occupancy maps can be obtained in real-time even on a CPU. Compared to traditional approaches such as Truncated Signed Distance Fields (TSDFs), our map representation is significantly more robust in yielding a better scene completeness given noisy inputs. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in thorough experimental validation on real-world datasets with varying degrees of added pose noise.",

      "abstractNote": "Path planning plays a vital role in robot navigation and manipulation, and multiple types of algorithms have been introduced to address this problem. Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) based algorithms have many advantages over other path planning algorithms. For example, RRT is suitable to solve the path planning problem in high dimensional space and can easily handle robot differential constraints. Informed RRT* is a method that uses the prolate hyper-spheroid to speed up the optimization process, but its efficiency will decrease to the same level as RRT* when the hyper-spheroid covers most of the state space. To overcome this drawback, we further propose a Sliding-Window Informed RRT* (SWIRRT*), which combines the sliding-window thought into the Informed RRT*, taking the advantage of the initial path and make the path optimization much faster. Simulations in 2D space have been carried out to demonstrate that our proposed method can improve the RRT-like algorithm's convergence speed.",

      "abstractNote": "There is extensive literature on using convex optimization to derive piece-wise polynomial trajectories for controlling differential ﬂat systems with applications to three-dimensional ﬂight for Micro Aerial Vehicles. In this work, we propose a method to formulate trajectory generation as a quadratic program (QP) using the concept of a Safe Flight Corridor (SFC). The SFC is a collection of convex overlapping polyhedra that models free space and provides a connected path from the robot to the goal position. We derive an efﬁcient convex decomposition method that builds the SFC from a piece-wise linear skeleton obtained using a fast graph search technique. The SFC provides a set of linear inequality constraints in the QP allowing real-time motion planning. Because the range and ﬁeld of view of the robot’s sensors are limited, we develop a framework of Receding Horizon Planning, which plans trajectories within a ﬁnite footprint in the local map, continuously updating the trajectory through a re-planning process. The re-planning process takes between 50 to 300 ms for a large and cluttered map. We show the feasibility of our approach, its completeness and performance, with applications to high-speed ﬂight in both simulated and physical experiments using quadrotors.",

      "title": "A Prior Information Heuristic based Robot Exploration Method in Indoor Environment",
      "abstractNote": "The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) based method has been widely used in robotic exploration, which achieves better performance than other exploration methods in most scenes. However, its core idea is a greedy strategy, that is, the robot chooses the frontier with the largest revenue value as the target point regardless of the explored environment structure. It is inevitable that before a certain area is fully explored, the robot will turn to other areas to explore, resulting in the backtracking phenomenon with a relatively lower exploration efficiency. In this paper, inspired by the perception law of bionic human, a new exploration strategy is proposed on the basis of the prior information heuristic. Firstly, a lightweight network model is proposed for the recognition of the heuristic objects. Secondly, the prediction region is formed based on the position of the heuristic object, and the frontiers in this region are extracted by the method of image processing. Finally, a heuristic information gain model is designed to guide the robot to explore, which allocates priority to the frontiers within the heuristic object area, so that the robot can make effective use of the prior knowledge of the room in the scene. Priority is given to the exploration of one room completely and then to the next, which can greatly improve the efficiency of exploration. In the experimental studies, we compare our method with RRT based exploration method in different environments, and the experimental results prove the effectiveness of our method.",

      "abstractNote": "Robots operating in real-world settings often need to plan interactions with surrounding scene elements and therefore, it is crucial for them to understand their workspace at the level of individual objects. In this spirit, this work presents a novel approach to progressively build instance-level, dense 3D maps from color and depth cues acquired by either a moving RGB-D sensor or a camera-LiDAR setup, whose pose is being tracked. The proposed framework processes each input RGB image with a semantic instance segmentation neural network and uses depth information to extract a set of per-frame, semantically labeled 3D instance segments, which then get matched to object instances already identified in previous views. Following integration of these newly detected instance segments in a global volumetric map, an efficient label diffusion scheme that considers multi-view instance predictions together with the reconstructed scene geometry is used to refine 3D segmentation boundaries. Experiments on indoor benchmarking RGB-D sequences show that the proposed system achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of 3D segmentation accuracy, while reducing the computational processing cost required at each frame. Furthermore, the applicability of the system to challenging domains outside the traditional office scenes is demonstrated by testing it on a robotic excavator equipped with a calibrated camera-LiDAR setup, with the goal of segmenting individual boulders in a highly cluttered construction scenario.",

      "abstractNote": "Ever more robust, accurate and detailed mapping using visual sensing has proven to be an enabling factor for mobile robots across a wide variety of applications. For the next level of robot intelligence and intuitive user interaction, maps need to extend beyond geometry and appearance - they need to contain semantics. We address this challenge by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a state-of-the-art dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system, ElasticFusion, which provides long-term dense correspondences between frames of indoor RGB-D video even during loopy scanning trajectories. These correspondences allow the CNN's semantic predictions from multiple view points to be probabilistically fused into a map. This not only produces a useful semantic 3D map, but we also show on the NYUv2 dataset that fusing multiple predictions leads to an improvement even in the 2D semantic labelling over baseline single frame predictions. We also show that for a smaller reconstruction dataset with larger variation in prediction viewpoint, the improvement over single frame segmentation increases. Our system is efficient enough to allow real-time interactive use at frame-rates of ≈25Hz.",

      "abstractNote": "We present an approach for recognizing indoor scenes in object constellations that require object search by a mobile robot, as they cannot be captured from a single viewpoint. In our approach that we call Active Scene Recognition (ASR), robots predict object poses from learnt spatial relations that they combine with their estimates about present scenes. Our models for estimating scenes and predicting poses are Implicit Shape Model (ISM) trees from prior work [1]. ISMs model scenes as sets of objects with spatial relations in-between and are learnt from observations. In prior work [2], we presented a realization of ASR, limited to choosing orientations for a fixed robot head with an approach to search objects that uses positions and ignores types. In this paper, we introduce an integrated system that extends ASR to selecting positions and orientations of camera views for a mobile robot with a pivoting head. We contribute an approach for Next-Best-View estimation in object search on predicted object poses. It is defined on 6 DoF viewing frustums and optimizes the searched view, together with the objects to be searched in it, based on 6 DoF pose predictions. To prevent combinatorial explosion when searching camera pose space, we introduce a hierarchical approach to sample robot positions with increasing resolution.",

In such settings, it is necessary to allow for signiﬁcant excursions of the attitude from the hover state and small angle approximations cannot be justiﬁed for the roll and pitch. We develop an algorithm that enables the real-time generation of optimal trajectories through a sequence of 3-D positions and yaw angles, while ensuring safe passage through speciﬁed corridors and satisfying constraints on velocities, accelerations and inputs. A nonlinear controller ensures the faithful tracking of these trajectories. Experimental results illustrate the application of the method to fast motion (5-10 body lengths/second) in three-dimensional slalom courses.",

In our framework, a two-stage heuristic information gain-based next-view planning algorithm is performed to dynamically select and update candidate viewpoints, followed by immediate next-best-view extraction and corresponding motion planning. The two-stage planner consists of a frontier-based boundary coverage planner and a ﬁxed start open travelling salesman problem solver, such that the planner returns an exploration path with the consideration of global optimality in the context of accumulated space information. The effectiveness of our work is evaluated with simulation and experimental tests. The results and comparisons prove our system is able to autonomously explore the 3-D unknown environments and reconstruct the structural model with improved exploration efﬁciency in terms of path quality and total exploration time.",

      "title": "Surfel-Based Next Best View Planning",
      "abstractNote": "Next best view (NBV) planning is a central task for automated three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction in robotics. The most expensive phase of NBV computation is the view simulation step, where the information gain of a large number of candidate sensor poses are estimated. Usually, information gain is related to the visibility of unknown space from the simulated viewpoint. A well-established technique is to adopt a volumetric representation of the environment and to compute the NBV from ray casting by maximizing the number of unknown visible voxels. This letter explores a novel approach for NBV planning based on surfel representation of the environment. Surfels are oriented surface elements, such as circular disks, without explicit connectivity. A new kind of surfel is introduced to represent the frontier between empty and unknown space. Surfels are extracted during 3-D reconstruction, with minimal overhead, from a KinectFusion volumetric representation. Surfel rendering is used to generate images from each simulated sensor pose. Experiments in a real robot setup are reported. The proposed approach achieves better performance than volumetric algorithms based on ray casting implemented on graphics processing unit (GPU), with comparable results in terms of reconstruction quality. Moreover, surfel-based NBV planning can be applied in larger environments as a volumetric representation is limited by GPU memory.",

      "abstractNote": "We describe the use of multiple wide-angle sonar range measurements to map the surroundings of an autonomous mobile robot. A sonar range reading provides information concerning empty and occupied volumes in a cone (subtending 30 degrees in our case) in front of the sensor. The reading is modelled as probability profiles projected onto a rasterized map, where somewhere occupied and everywhere empty areas are represented. Range measurements from multiple points of view (taken from multiple sensors on the robot, and from the same sensors after robot moves) are systematically integrated in the map. Overlapping empty volumes re-inforce each other, and serve to condense the range of occupied volumes. The map definition improves as more readings are added. The final map shows regions probably occupied, probably unoccupied, and unknown areas. The method deals effectively with clutter, and can be used for motion planning and for extended landmark recognition. This system has been tested on the Neptune mobile robot at CMU.",

Due to the unpredictable nature of these environments, deep learning techniques can be used to perform these tasks. In this letter, we present the first use of deep learning to address the robot exploration task in USAR applications. In particular, we uniquely combine the traditional approach of frontier-based exploration with deep reinforcement learning to allow a robot to autonomously explore unknown cluttered environments. Experiments conducted with a mobile robot in unknown cluttered environments of varying sizes and layouts showed that the proposed exploration approach can effectively determine appropriate frontier locations to navigate to, while being robust to different environment layouts and sizes. Furthermore, a comparison study with other frontier exploration approaches showed that our learning-based frontier exploration technique was able to explore more of an environment earlier on, allowing for potential identification of a larger number of victims at the beginning of the time-critical exploration task.",

      "abstractNote": "Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have the advantage of moving freely in 3D space. However, creating compact and sparse map representations that can be efficiently used for planning for such robots is still an open problem. In this paper, we take maps built from noisy sensor data and construct a sparse graph containing topological information that can be used for 3D planning. We use a Euclidean Signed Distance Field, extract a 3D Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD), and obtain a thin skeleton diagram representing the topological structure of the environment. We then convert this skeleton diagram into a sparse graph, which we show is resistant to noise and changes in resolution. We demonstrate global planning over this graph, and the orders of magnitude speed-up it offers over other common planning methods. We validate our planning algorithm in real maps built onboard an MAV, using RGB-D sensing.",

      "abstractNote": "Many robot tasks, such as grasping and inspection, may require complete 3D models with enough surface details. Fully autonomous environment exploration and 3D reconstruction of unknown objects are challenging for a robot when little or no knowledge about an object is known as a priori. Previous work updated sensor measurements from a greedy ordered set of views into a map with an unchangeable voxel size, leading to the lack of details on the object surface, sampling problems, and no adaption to small objects. We propose a global max-flow-based multi-resolution next-best-view (NBV) method to improve performance on these problems. In particular, it utilizes a max-flow-based global view quality function to obtain optimal NBVs, and a multi-resolution strategy to optimize the reconstruction quality and efficiency. Results of comparative simulation experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods show that our method achieves a higher voxel coverage under the same resolution. Parametric and ablation studies confirm that the global view function and multi-resolution strategy are effective. Results of real-world experiments show that our method achieves complete reconstruction of small objects with only 6–8 views.",

The proposed planner follows a two–step, receding horizon, belief space–based approach. At ﬁrst, in an online computed tree the algorithm ﬁnds the branch that optimizes the amount of space expected to be explored. The ﬁrst viewpoint conﬁguration of this branch is selected, but the path towards it is decided through a second planning step. Within that, a new tree is sampled, admissible branches arriving at the reference viewpoint are found and the robot belief about its state and the tracked landmarks of the environment is propagated. The branch that minimizes the expected localization and mapping uncertainty is selected, the corresponding path is executed by the robot and the whole process is iteratively repeated. The proposed planner is capable of running online onboard a small aerial robot and its performance is evaluated using experimental studies in a challenging environment.",

      "title": "Next-Best-Sense: A Multi-Criteria Robotic Exploration Strategy for RFID Tags Discovery",
      "abstractNote": "Automated exploration is one of the most relevant applications for autonomous robots. In this letter, we propose a novel online coverage algorithm called Next-Best-Sense (NBS), an extension of the Next-Best-View class of exploration algorithms which optimizes the exploration task balancing multiple criteria. NBS is applied to the problem of localizing all Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags with a mobile robot. We cast this problem as a coverage planning problem by defining a basic sensing operation - a scan with the RFID reader - as the field of “view” of the sensor. NBS evaluates candidate locations with a global utility function which combines utility values for travel distance, information gain, sensing time, battery status and RFID information gain, generalizing the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Making. We developed an RFID reader and tag model in the Gazebo simulator for validation. Experiments performed both in simulation and with a robot suggest that our NBS approach can successfully localize all the RFID tags while minimizing navigation metrics, such sensing operations, total traveling distance and battery consumption. The code developed is publicly available on the authors' repository.11https://github.com/LCAS/nbs.",

      "abstractNote": "Information gathering algorithms play a key role in unlocking the potential of robots for efficient data collection in a wide range of applications. However, most existing strategies neglect the fundamental problem of the robot pose uncertainty, which is an implicit requirement for creating robust, high-quality maps. To address this issue, we introduce an informative planning framework for active mapping that explicitly accounts for the pose uncertainty in both the mapping and planning tasks. Our strategy exploits a Gaussian Process (GP) model to capture a target environmental field given the uncertainty on its inputs. For planning, we formulate a new utility function that couples the localization and field mapping objectives in GP-based mapping scenarios in a principled way, without relying on manually-tuned parameters. Extensive simulations show that our approach outperforms existing strategies, reducing mean pose uncertainty and map error. We present a proof of concept in an indoor temperature mapping scenario.",

      "abstractNote": "Trajectory generation approaches for mobile robots generally aim to optimize with respect to a cost function such as energy, execution time, or other mission-relevant parameters within the constraints of vehicle dynamics and obstacles in the environment. We propose to add the cost of state observability to the trajectory optimization in order to ensure fast and accurate state estimation throughout the mission while still respecting the constraints of vehicle dynamics and the environment. Our approach ﬁnds a dynamically feasible estimation-optimized trajectory in a sequence of connected convex polytopes representing free space in the environment. In addition, we show a statistical procedure that enables observability-aware trajectory optimization for heterogeneous states in the system both in magnitude and units, which was not supported in previous formulations. We validate our approach with extensive simulations of a visualinertial state estimator on an aerial platform as a speciﬁc realization of our general method. We show that the optimized trajectories lead to more accurate navigation while eliminating the need for a separate calibration procedure.",

      "title": "NeurAR: Neural Uncertainty for Autonomous 3D Reconstruction With Implicit Neural Representations",
      "abstractNote": "Implicit neural representations have shown compelling results in offline 3D reconstruction and also recently demonstrated the potential for online SLAM systems. However, applying them to autonomous 3D reconstruction, where a robot is required to explore a scene and plan a view path for the reconstruction, has not been studied. In this paper, we explore for the first time the possibility of using implicit neural representations for autonomous 3D scene reconstruction by addressing two key challenges: 1) seeking a criterion to measure the quality of the candidate viewpoints for the view planning based on the new representations, and 2) learning the criterion from data that can generalize to different scenes instead of a hand-crafting one. To solve the challenges, firstly, a proxy of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is proposed to quantify a viewpoint quality; secondly, the proxy is optimized jointly with the parameters of an implicit neural network for the scene. With the proposed view quality criterion from neural networks (termed as Neural Uncertainty), we can then apply implicit representations to autonomous 3D reconstruction. Our method demonstrates significant improvements on various metrics for the rendered image quality and the geometry quality of the reconstructed 3D models when compared with variants using TSDF or reconstruction without view planning.",

The planner uses a combination of Next-Best-View (NBV) sampling and frontier-based approaches to reduce the impact of finding unexplored areas in large scenarios. For each sampled point, the yaw angle is optimized to maximize the potential gain for mapping. The gain is expressed as a ratio between the exploration objective and the time it would take to reach the pose, thus, balancing the nearby exploration and global coverage. We reduce the gain computation bottleneck in the sampling strategy by managing a dual-map with different resolutions. The planner maintains a history graph, with nodes that indicate regions of interest for map expansion. We demonstrate the abilities of the proposed algorithm with simulations and real-world experiments. The results outperform state-of-the-art methods in exploration time and computational cost.",

      "title": "Polynomial Trajectory Planning for Aggressive Quadrotor Flight in Dense Indoor Environments",
      "abstractNote": "We explore the challenges of planning trajectories for quadrotors through cluttered indoor environments. We extend the existing work on polynomial trajectory generation by presenting a method of jointly optimizing polynomial path segments in an unconstrained quadratic program that is numerically stable for high-order polynomials and large numbers of segments, and is easily formulated for efﬁcient sparse computation. We also present a technique for automatically selecting the amount of time allocated to each segment, and hence the quadrotor speeds along the path, as a function of a single parameter determining aggressiveness, subject to actuator constraints. The use of polynomial trajectories, coupled with the differentially ﬂat representation of the quadrotor, eliminates the need for computationally intensive sampling and simulation in the high dimensional state space of the vehicle during motion planning. Our approach generates high-quality trajecrtories much faster than purely sampling-based optimal kinodynamic planning methods, but sacriﬁces the guarantee of asymptotic convergence to the global optimum that those methods provide. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by efﬁciently generating trajectories through challenging indoor spaces and successfully traversing them at speeds up to 8 m/s. A demonstration of our algorithm and ﬂight performance is available at: http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/quad_polynomial_trajectory_planning.",

      "abstractNote": "We tackle the problem of ﬂying time-optimal trajectories through multiple waypoints with quadrotors. State-ofthe-art solutions split the problem into a planning task—where a global, time-optimal trajectory is generated—and a control task—where this trajectory is accurately tracked. However, at the current state, generating a time-optimal trajectory that takes the full quadrotor model into account is computationally demanding (in the order of minutes or even hours). This is detrimental for replanning in presence of disturbances. We overcome this issue by solving the time-optimal planning and control problems concurrently via Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC). Our MPCC optimally selects the future states of the platform at runtime, while maximizing the progress along the reference path and minimizing the distance to it. We show that, even when tracking simpliﬁed trajectories, the proposed MPCC results in a path that approaches the true time-optimal one, and which can be generated in real-time. We validate our approach in the realworld, where we show that our method outperforms both the current state-of-the-art and a world-class human pilot in terms of lap time achieving speeds of up to 60 km/h.",

      "abstractNote": "We provide an open-source C++ library for real-time metric-semantic visual-inertial Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS-Mono, OKVIS, ROVIO) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch.",

      "abstractNote": "The ability to plan informative paths online is essential to robot autonomy. In particular, sampling-based approaches are often used as they are capable of using arbitrary information gain formulations. However, they are prone to local minima, resulting in sub-optimal trajectories, and sometimes do not reach global coverage. In this letter, we present a new RRT*-inspired online informative path planning algorithm. Our method continuously expands a single tree of candidate trajectories and rewires nodes to maintain the tree and reﬁne intermediate paths. This allows the algorithm to achieve global coverage and maximize the utility of a path in a global context, using a single objective function. We demonstrate the algorithm’s capabilities in the applications of autonomous indoor exploration as well as accurate Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF)-based 3D reconstruction on-board a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). We study the impact of commonly used information gain and cost formulations in these scenarios and propose a novel TSDF-based 3D reconstruction gain and cost-utility formulation. Detailed evaluation in realistic simulation environments show that our approach outperforms sampling-based state of the art methods in these tasks. Experiments on a real MAV demonstrate the ability of our method to robustly plan in real-time, exploring an indoor environment with on-board sensing and computation. We make our framework available for future research.",

      "abstractNote": "Exploration is a fundamental problem in robotics. While sampling-based planners have shown high performance and robustness, they are oftentimes compute intensive and can exhibit high variance. To this end, we propose to learn both components of sampling-based exploration. We present a method to directly learn an underlying informed distribution of views based on the spatial context in the robot’s map, and further explore a variety of methods to also learn the information gain of each sample. We show in thorough experimental evaluation that our proposed system improves exploration performance by up to 28% over classical methods, and find that learning the gains in addition to the sampling distribution can provide favorable performance vs. compute trade-offs for compute-constrained systems. We demonstrate in simulation and on a low-cost mobile robot that our system generalizes well to varying environments.",

      "abstractNote": "Exploration of unknown environments is a fundamental problem in robotics and an essential component in numerous applications of autonomous systems. A major challenge in exploring unknown environments is that the robot has to plan with the limited information available at each time step. While most current approaches rely on heuristics and assumption to plan paths based on these partial observations, we instead propose a novel way to integrate deep learning into exploration by leveraging 3D scene completion for informed, safe, and interpretable exploration mapping and planning. Our approach, SC-Explorer, combines scene completion using a novel incremental fusion mechanism and a newly proposed hierarchical multi-layer mapping approach, to guarantee safety and efficiency of the robot. We further present an informative path planning method, leveraging the capabilities of our mapping approach and a novel scene-completion-aware information gain. While our method is generally applicable, we evaluate it in the use case of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). We thoroughly study each component in high-fidelity simulation experiments using only mobile hardware, and show that our method can speed up coverage of an environment by 73% compared to the baselines with only minimal reduction in map accuracy. Even if scene completions are not included in the final map, we show that they can be used to guide the robot to choose more informative paths, speeding up the measurement of the scene with the robot's sensors by 35%. We validate our system on a fully autonomous MAV, showing rapid and reliable scene coverage even in a complex cluttered environment. We make our methods available as open-source.",

      "abstractNote": "Exploration is a fundamental problem in robot autonomy. A major limitation, however, is that during exploration robots oftentimes have to rely on on-board systems alone for state estimation, accumulating significant drift over time in large environments. Drift can be detrimental to robot safety and exploration performance. In this work, a submap-based, multi-layer approach for both mapping and planning is proposed to enable safe and efficient volumetric exploration of large scale environments despite odometry drift. The central idea of our approach combines local (temporally and spatially) and global mapping to guarantee safety and efficiency. Similarly, our planning approach leverages the presented map to compute global volumetric frontiers in a changing global map and utilizes the nature of exploration dealing with partial information for efficient local and global planning. The presented system is thoroughly evaluated and shown to outperform state of the art methods even under drift-free conditions. Our system, termed GLocal, is made available open source.",

      "abstractNote": "Exploration is an important aspect of robotics, whether it is for mapping, rescue missions, or path planning in an unknown environment. Frontier Exploration planning (FEP) and Receding Horizon Next-Best-View planning (RH-NBVP) are two different approaches with different strengths and weaknesses. FEP explores a large environment consisting of separate regions with ease, but is slow at reaching full exploration due to moving back and forth between regions. RH-NBVP shows great potential and efﬁciently explores individual regions, but has the disadvantage that it can get stuck in large environments not exploring all regions. In this letter, we present a method that combines both approaches, with FEP as a global exploration planner and RH-NBVP for local exploration. We also present techniques to estimate potential information gain faster, to cache previously estimated gains and to exploit these to efﬁciently estimate new queries.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we present a new method to determine the “next best view” (NBV) solution for accurate 3D reconstruction of an object with minimum prior information about the object's geometry. The proposed method determines the best visible surface of unknown objects using an adaptive mean shift algorithm which avoids the inaccessible position. The proposed method automatically generates the 3D model of objects in real time with a minimum number of best visible surface patches while the objects are moving on a turntable. By generating a set of potential next views, the proposed method ensures proper avoidance of unreachable positions. The number of views required to reconstruct a 3D model of objects depends upon their complexity. The proposed method is applicable to all kinds of range sensors and experimental results validate the proposed method for 3D modeling of real objects and prove its robustness.",

      "abstractNote": "In this study, we address an exploration problem when constructing complete 3D models in an unknown environment using a Micro-Aerial Vehicle. Most previous exploration methods were based on the Next-Best-View (NBV) approaches, which iteratively determine the most informative view, that exposes the greatest unknown area from the current partial model. However, these approaches sometimes miss minor unreconstructed regions like holes or sparse surfaces (while these can be important features). Furthermore, because the NBV methods iterate the next-best path from a current partial view, they sometimes produce unnecessarily long trajectories by revisiting known regions. To address these problems, we propose a novel exploration algorithm that integrates coverage and inspection strategies. The suggested algorithm ﬁrst computes a global plan to cover unexplored regions to complete the target model sequentially. It then plans local inspection paths that comprehensively scans local frontiers. This approach reduces the total exploration time and improves the completeness of the reconstructed models. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches through simulated and real-world experiments. The results show that our algorithm outperforms the other approaches and in particular improves the completeness of surface coverage.",

      "abstractNote": "In this study, we address an exploration problem when constructing complete 3D models in an unknown environment using a Micro-Aerial Vehicle. Most previous exploration methods were based on the Next-Best-View (NBV) approaches, which iteratively determine the most informative view, that exposes the greatest unknown area from the current partial model. However, these approaches sometimes miss minor unreconstructed regions like holes or sparse surfaces (while these can be important features). Furthermore, because the NBV methods iterate the next-best path from a current partial view, they sometimes produce unnecessarily long trajectories by revisiting known regions. To address these problems, we propose a novel exploration algorithm that integrates coverage and inspection strategies. The suggested algorithm ﬁrst computes a global plan to cover unexplored regions to complete the target model sequentially. It then plans local inspection paths that comprehensively scans local frontiers. This approach reduces the total exploration time and improves the completeness of the reconstructed models. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches through simulated and real-world experiments. The results show that our algorithm outperforms the other approaches and in particular improves the completeness of surface coverage.",

      "abstractNote": "This study addresses a view-path-planning problem during 3-D scanning of a large-scale structure based on multiview stereo (MVS) for unmanned aerial platforms. Recently, most studies have adopted an explore-then-exploit strategy for 3-D scanning. The strategy first generates a coarse model from a simple overhead scanning and then plans an inspection path to cover the entire surface of the coarse model. However, even though the inspection path may be optimal, it is difficult to guarantee a complete and accurate reconstruction result due to defective factors of MVS such as occlusions, textureless surfaces, and insufficient parallaxes. Furthermore, the entire procedure of this strategy is inefficiently slow because of path redundancies and long MVS processing time. Therefore, we propose a novel view-path-planning method for 3-D scanning based on an online MVS reconstruction algorithm. The suggested method incrementally reconstructs the target model online and iteratively plans view paths by analyzing the current partial reconstructions. The method continuously analyzes the quality of the model and detects inaccurately reconstructed surfaces. It then plans an inspection path that provides a complete coverage of the detected surfaces while maximizing the performance of MVS. This method can construct a complete 3-D model in a single scanning trial without the need for rescanning. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods, especially in terms of the model completeness of complex structures.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we present a novel strategy to compute minimum-time trajectories for quadrotors in constrained environments. In particular, we consider the motion in a given ﬂying region with obstacles and take into account the physical limitations of the vehicle. Instead of approaching the optimization problem in its standard time-parameterized formulation, the proposed strategy is based on an appealing reformulation. Transverse coordinates, expressing the distance from a frame path, are used to parameterize the vehicle position and a spatial parameter is used as independent variable. This reformulation allows us to: 1) obtain a ﬁxed horizon problem and 2) easily formulate (fairly complex) position constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is proven by numerical computations on two different illustrative scenarios. Moreover, the optimal trajectory generated in the second scenario is experimentally executed with a real nanoquadrotor in order to show its feasibility.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents an efﬁcient optimization framework that solves trajectory optimization problems efﬁciently by decoupling state variables from timing variables, thereby decomposing a challenging nonlinear programming (NLP) problem into two easier subproblems. With timing ﬁxed, the state variables can be optimized efﬁciently using convex optimization, and so the time variables can be optimized using a separate outer optimization. This is a bilevel optimization in which the outer objective function itself requires an optimization to compute. The challenge is that gradient optimization methods require the gradient of the objective function with respect to the time variables, which is not available. Whereas the ﬁnite difference method must solve many optimization problems to compute a gradient, this paper proposes a more efﬁcient method: the dual solution (Lagrange multipliers) of the convex optimization problem is exploited to calculate the analytical gradient. Since the dual solution is a by-product of the convex optimization problem, the gradient can be obtained “for free” with high accuracy. The framework is demonstrated on solving minimum-jerk trajectory optimization problems in safety corridors for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Experiments demonstrate that bilevel optimization improves performance over a standard NLP solver, and analytical gradients outperforms ﬁnite differences. With a 40 ms cutoff time, our approach achieves over 8 times better suboptimality than the current state-of-theart.",

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous exploration is a crucial aspect of robotics that has numerous applications. Most of the existing methods greedily choose goals that maximize immediate reward. This strategy is computationally efficient but insufficient for overall exploration efficiency. In recent years, some state-of-the-art methods are proposed, which generate a global coverage path and significantly improve overall exploration efficiency. However, global optimization produces high computational overhead, leading to low-frequency planner updates and inconsistent planning motion. In this work, we propose a novel method to support fast UAV exploration in large-scale and cluttered 3-D environments. We introduce a computationally low-cost viewpoints generation method using novel occlusion-free spheres. Additionally, we combine greedy strategy with global optimization, which considers both computational and exploration efficiency. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art methods to showcase its superiority in terms of exploration efficiency and computational time. We conduct various real-world experiments to demonstrate the excellent performance of our method in large-scale and cluttered environments.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper presents a general framework to ﬁnd time-optimal trajectories for dynamic vehicles like drones and autonomous cars. Hindered by its nonlinear objective and complex constraints, this problem is hard even for state-ofthe-art nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers. The proposed framework addresses the problem by bilevel optimization. Speciﬁcally, the original problem is divided into an inner layer, which computes a time-optimal velocity proﬁle along a ﬁxed geometric path, and an outer layer, which reﬁnes the geometric path by a Quasi-Newton method. The inner optimization is convex and efﬁciently solved by interior-point methods. A novel variable reordering method is introduced to accelerate the optimization of the velocity proﬁle. The gradients of the outer layer can be derived from the Lagrange multipliers using sensitivity analysis of parametric optimization problems. The method is guaranteed to return a feasible solution at any time, and numerical experiments on a ground vehicle with friction circle dynamics model show that the proposed method performs more robustly than general NLP solvers.",

      "abstractNote": "High-speed trajectory planning through unknown environments requires algorithmic techniques that enable fast reaction times while maintaining safety as new information about the operating environment is obtained. The requirement of computational tractability typically leads to optimization problems that do not include the obstacle constraints (collision checks are done on the solutions) or use a convex decomposition of the free space and then impose an ad-hoc time allocation scheme for each interval of the trajectory. Moreover, safety guarantees are usually obtained by having a local planner that plans a trajectory with a ﬁnal “stop” condition in the freeknown space. However, these two decisions typically lead to slow and conservative trajectories. We propose FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner) to overcome these issues. FASTER obtains high-speed trajectories by enabling the local planner to optimize in both the free-known and unknown spaces. Safety guarantees are ensured by always having a feasible, safe back-up trajectory in the free-known space at the start of each replanning step. Furthermore, we present a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program formulation in which the solver can choose the trajectory interval allocation, and where a time allocation heuristic is computed efﬁciently using the result of the previous replanning iteration. This proposed algorithm is tested extensively both in simulation and in real hardware, showing agile ﬂights in unknown cluttered environments with velocities up to 3.6 m/s.",

      "title": "FASTER: Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner for Navigation in Unknown Environments",
      "abstractNote": "Planning high-speed trajectories for UAVs in unknown environments requires algorithmic techniques that enable fast reaction times to guarantee safety as more information about the environment becomes available. The standard approach to ensure safety is to enforce a “stop” condition in the free-known space. However, this can severely limit the speed of the vehicle, especially in situations where much of the world is unknown. Moreover, the ad-hoc time and interval allocation scheme usually imposed on the trajectory also leads to conservative and slower trajectories. This work proposes FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner) to ensure safety without sacriﬁcing speed. FASTER obtains high-speed trajectories by enabling the local planner to optimize in both the free-known and unknown spaces. Safety guarantees are ensured by always having a feasible, safe back-up trajectory in the free-known space at the start of each replanning step. The Mixed Integer Quadratic Program formulation proposed allows the solver to choose the trajectory interval allocation, and the time allocation is found by a line search algorithm initialized with a heuristic computed from the previous replanning iteration. This proposed algorithm is tested extensively both in simulation and in real hardware, showing agile ﬂights in unknown cluttered environments with velocities up to 7.8 m/s. To demonstrate the generality of the proposed framework, FASTER is also applied to a skid-steer robot, and the maximum speed speciﬁed for the robot (2 m/s) is achieved in real hardware experiments.",

      "abstractNote": "Three-dimensional (3D) object reconstruction is the process of building a 3D model of a real object. This task is performed by taking several scans of an object from different locations (views). Due to the limited ﬁeld of view of the sensor and the object’s self-occlusions, it is a difﬁcult problem to solve. In addition, sensor positioning by robots is not perfect, making the actual view different from the expected one. We propose a next best view (NBV) algorithm that determines each view to reconstruct an arbitrary object. Furthermore, we propose a method to deal with the uncertainty in sensor positioning. The algorithm fulﬁlls all the constraints of a reconstruction process, such as new information, positioning constraints, sensing constraints and registration constraints. Moreover, it improves the scan’s quality and reduces the navigation distance. The algorithm is based on a search-based paradigm where a set of candidate views is generated and then each candidate view is evaluated to determine which one is the best. To deal with positioning uncertainty, we propose a second stage which re-evaluates the views according to their neighbours, such that the best view is that which is within a region of the good views. The results of simulation and comparisons with previous approaches are presented.",

We propose a novel, simple network architecture based solely onan attention mechanism, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superiorin quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less timeto train.

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous exploration is one of the key components for flying robots in 3D active perception. Fast and accurate exploration algorithms are essential for aerial vehicles due to their limited flight endurance. In this paper, we address the problem of exploring the environment and acquiring information using aerial vehicles within limited flight endurance. We propose an information potential field based method for autonomous exploration in 3D environments. In contrast to the existing approaches that only consider either the traveled distances or the information collected during exploration, our method takes into account both the traveled cost and information-gain. The next best view point is chosen based on a multi-objective function which considers information of several candidate regions and the traveled path cost. The selected goal attracts the robot while the known obstacles form the repulsive force to repel the robot. These combined force drives the robot to explore the environment. Different from planners that use all acquired global information, our planner only considers the goal selected and the nearby obstacles, which is more efficient in high-dimensional environments. Furthermore, we present a method to help the robot escape when it falls into a trapped area. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed method.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we propose a novel path planning framework for autonomous exploration in unknown environments using a mobile robot. A graph structure is incrementally constructed along with the exploration process. The structure is the road map that represents the topology of the explored environment. To construct the road map, we design a sampling strategy to get random points in the explored environment uniformly. A global path from the current location of the robot to the target area can be found on this road map efficiently. We utilize a lazy collision checking method that only checks the feasibility of the generated global path to improve the planning efficiency. The feasible global path is further optimized with our proposed trajectory optimization method considering the motion constraints of the robot. This mechanism can facilitate the path cost evaluation for the next best view selection. In order to select the next best target region, we propose a utility function that takes into account both the path cost and the information gain of a candidate target region. Moreover, we present a target reselection mechanism to evaluate the target region and reduce the extra path cost. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach are demonstrated using a mobile robot in both simulation and real experimental studies.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we study the problem of autonomous exploration in unknown indoor environments using mobile robot. We use mutual information (MI) to evaluate the information the robot would get at a certain location. In order to get the most informative sensing location, we first propose a sampling method that can get random sensing patches in free space. Each sensing patch is extended to informative locations to collect information with true values. Then we use Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF) to model the distribution of MI in environment. Compared with the traditional methods that employ Gaussian Process (GP) model, GMRF is more efficient. MI of every sensing location can be estimated using the training sample patches and the established GMRF model. We utilize an efficient computation algorithm to estimate the GMRF model hyperparameters so as to speed up the computation. Besides the information gain of the candidates regions, the path cost is also considered in this work. We propose a utility function that can balance the path cost and the information gain the robot would collect. We tested our algorithm in both simulated and real experiment. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method can explore the environment efficiently with relatively shorter path length.",

      "abstractNote": "This letter presents a novel and integrated framework for Next-Best-View (NBV) selection toward autonomous robotic exploration in indoor environments. A topological map, named semantic road map (SRM), is proposed to represent the explored environment during the exploration. The basic concept of the SRM is to construct a graph with nodes containing the exploration states and with edges satisfying the collision-free constraints. Especially, the SRM integrates both semantic and structure information of the environment, which possesses the beneﬁcial properties of using a topological map in the exploration. It is worth noting that the proposed SRM is incrementally built along with the exploration process, thereby, avoiding the unnecessary reconsideration of the explored areas when constructing the topological map. Based on the SRM, a novel decision model with semantic information is presented for determining the NBV during the exploration. Moreover, the decision model takes into account both information gain and cost-to-go of a candidate NBV, which can be queried efﬁciently on the SRM, enabling the efﬁcient exploration of the environment. The effectiveness and efﬁciency of the proposed system are assessed and demonstrated using both simulated and real-world indoor experiments.",

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous 3-D exploration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is increasingly prevalent for environment monitoring without human intervention. In this article, we present a systematic solution toward efficient UAV exploration in 3-D environments. Innovatively, a road map is incrementally built and maintained along with the exploration process, which explicitly exhibits the topological structure of the 3-D environment. By simplifying the environment, the road map can efficiently provide the information gain and the cost-to-go for a candidate region to be explored, which are two quantities for next-best-view (NBV) evaluation, thus prompting the efficiency for NBV determination. In addition, with reference to the global plan queried on the road map, we propose a local planner based on the potential field method that drives the robot to the information-rich area during the navigation process, which further improves the exploration efficiency. The proposed framework and its composed modules are verified in various 3-D environments, which exhibit their distinctive features in NBV selection and better performance in improving the exploration efficiency than other methods.",

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous exploration in unknown environments is a fundamental task for robots. Existing approaches mostly were concentrated on the efficiency of the exploration with the assumption of perfect state estimation, but the drift of pose estimation in visual SLAM occurs frequently and is detrimental to robot's localization and exploration performance. In this paper, a perception-aware exploration(PAE) method is proposed for rapidly and safely autonomous exploration in outdoor environments. The adaptive semantic information is proposed to improve the robustness of perception. Based on the perception module, both the selection of exploration goal on a novel weighted information gain and path planning can avoid the areas with high localization uncertainty. In addition, thanks to the proposed pipeline, including scan-based frontier detection, kd-tree based map prediction and suboptimal frontier buffer strategy, the PAE planner can explore the environment with high success rate and high efficiency. Several simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of our methods.",

      "abstractNote": "In autonomous navigation, sensors suffer from massive occlusion in cluttered environments, leaving a significant amount of space unknown. In practice, treating the unknown space in optimistic or pessimistic ways both set limitations on planning performance. Therefore, aggressiveness and safety cannot be satisfied at the same time. Mimicking human behavior, in this paper, we propose a method based on deep neural network to predict occupancy distribution of unknown space. Specifically, the proposed method utilizes contextual information of environments and prior knowledge to predict obstacle distributions in the occluded space. Our self-supervised learning method use unlabeled and no-ground-truth data and augments the data by simulating navigation trajectories. Our Occupancy Prediction Network is faster than current SOTA scene completion models and is successfully applied to unseen test environments without any refinement. Results show that our predictor leverages the performance of a kinodynamic planner by improving security with no reduction of speed in cluttered environments.",

      "abstractNote": "The visibility of targets determines performance and even success rate of various applications, such as active slam, exploration, and target tracking. Therefore, it is crucial to take the visibility of targets into explicit account in trajectory planning. In this paper, we propose a general metric for target visibility, considering observation distance and angle as well as occlusion effect. We formulate this metric into a differentiable visibility cost function, with which spatial trajectory and yaw can be jointly optimized. Furthermore, this visibility-aware trajectory optimization handles dynamic feasibility of position and yaw simultaneously. To validate that our method is practical and generic, we integrate it into a customized quadrotor tracking system. The experimental results show that our visibility-aware planner performs more robustly and observes targets better. In order to benefit related researches, we release our code to the public.",

      "abstractNote": "Many scenarios require a robot to be able to explore its 3D environment online without human supervision. This is especially relevant for inspection tasks and search and rescue missions. To solve this high-dimensional path planning problem, sampling-based exploration algorithms have proven successful. However, these do not necessarily scale well to larger environments or spaces with narrow openings. This paper presents a 3D exploration planner based on the principles of Next-Best Views (NBVs). In this approach, a Micro-Aerial Vehicle (MAV)equipped with a limited field-of-view depth sensor randomly samples its configuration space to find promising future viewpoints. In order to obtain high sampling efficiency, our planner maintains and uses a history of visited places, and locally optimizes the robot's orientation with respect to unobserved space. We evaluate our method in several simulated scenarios, and compare it against a state-of-the-art exploration algorithm. The experiments show substantial improvements in exploration time (2 ⨯ faster), computation time, and path length, and advantages in handling difficult situations such as escaping dead-ends (up to 20 ⨯ faster). Finally, we validate the on-line capability of our algorithm on a computational constrained real world MAV.",

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous exploration requires robots to generate informative trajectories iteratively. Although sampling-based methods are highly efficient in unmanned aerial vehicle exploration, many of these methods do not effectively utilize the sampled information from the previous planning iterations, leading to redundant computation and longer exploration time. Also, few have explicitly shown their exploration ability in dynamic environments even though they can run real-time. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel dynamic exploration planner (DEP) for exploring unknown environments using incremental sampling and Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM). In our sampling strategy, nodes are added incrementally and distributed evenly in the explored region, yielding the best viewpoints. To further shortening exploration time and ensuring safety, our planner optimizes paths locally and refine them based on the Euclidean Signed Distance Function (ESDF) map. Meanwhile, as the multi-query planner, PRM allows the proposed planner to quickly search alternative paths to avoid dynamic obstacles for safe exploration. Simulation experiments show that our method safely explores dynamic environments and outperforms the benchmark planners in terms of exploration time, path length, and computational time.",

      "title": "HiTMap: A Hierarchical Topological Map Representation for Navigation in Unknown Environments",
      "abstractNote": "The ability to autonomously navigate in unknown environments is important for mobile robots. The map is the core component to achieve this. Most map representations rely on drift-free state estimation and provide a global metric map to navigate. However, in large-scale real-world applications, it's hard to prohibit drifts and compose a globally consistent map quickly. In this paper, a novel representation named, HiTMap, is proposed to enhance the existing map representations. The central idea is to adopt a submap-based hierarchical topology rather than a global metric map so that only a local metric map is maintained for obstacle avoidance which ensures the lightweight of the representation. To guide the robots navigate into unknown spaces, frontiers are detected and attached to the map as an attribute. We also develop a path planning module to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of our map representation. The system is validated in a simulation environment and a demonstration in the real world is conducted. In addition, the HiTMap is made available open-source.",

      "abstractNote": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are capable of operating tasks in challenging environments of high risk for humans. However, these tasks usually require UAVs to plan motion in environments where GPS is unavailable. This paper implements a UAV system of motion planning and obstacle avoidance in GPS-denied indoor environments with the visual-inertial odometry (VIO) approach. Collecting measurements from stereo cameras and IMU, the visual-inertial odometry estimates the states of the UAV by jointly minimizing visual and inertial residuals and solving the nonlinear optimization problem. Then we utilize the minimum snap method to generate feasible trajectories based on the estimated states provided by VIO and an obstacle map of the indoor environment. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, we perform experiments on a UAV platform and the results show that the UAV accurately follows the planned trajectory and avoids obstacles without the aid of GPS.",

By moving to new frontiers, a mobile robot can extend its map into new territory until the entire environment has been explored. We describe a method for detecting frontiers in evidence grids and navigating to these frontiers. We also introduce a technique for minimizing specular reﬂections in evidence grids using laser-limited sonar. We have tested this approach with a real mobile robot, exploring real-world ofﬁce environments cluttered with a variety of obstacles. An advantage of our approach is its ability to explore both large open spaces and narrow cluttered spaces, with walls and obstacles in arbitrary orientations.",

Although MAVs equipped with 3D sensing are starting to be used in industry, they currently must be remotely controlled by a skilled pilot. In this paper we present an exploration path planning approach for MAVs equipped with 3D range sensors like lidar. The only user input that our approach requires is a 3D bounding box around the structure. Our method incrementally plans a path for a MAV to scan all surfaces of the structure up to a resolution and detects when exploration is ﬁnished. We demonstrate our method by modeling a train bridge and show that our method builds 3D models with the efﬁciency of a skilled pilot.",

      "abstractNote": "Semantic segmentation requires both rich spatial information and sizeable receptive ﬁeld. However, modern approaches usually compromise spatial resolution to achieve real-time inference speed, which leads to poor performance. In this paper, we address this dilemma with a novel Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet). We ﬁrst design a Spatial Path with a small stride to preserve the spatial information and generate high-resolution features. Meanwhile, a Context Path with a fast downsampling strategy is employed to obtain suﬃcient receptive ﬁeld. On top of the two paths, we introduce a new Feature Fusion Module to combine features eﬃciently. The proposed architecture makes a right balance between the speed and segmentation performance on Cityscapes, CamVid, and COCO-Stuﬀ datasets. Speciﬁcally, for a 2048×1024 input, we achieve 68.4% Mean IOU on the Cityscapes test dataset with speed of 105 FPS on one NVIDIA Titan XP card, which is signiﬁcantly faster than the existing methods with comparable performance.",

      "title": "BiSeNet V2: Bilateral Network with Guided Aggregation for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation",
      "abstractNote": "Low-level details and high-level semantics are both essential to the semantic segmentation task. However, to speed up the model inference, current approaches almost always sacrifice the low-level details, leading to a considerable decrease in accuracy. We propose to treat these spatial details and categorical semantics separately to achieve high accuracy and high efficiency for real-time semantic segmentation. For this purpose, we propose an efficient and effective architecture with a good trade-off between speed and accuracy, termed Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet V2). This architecture involves the following: (i) A detail branch, with wide channels and shallow layers to capture low-level details and generate high-resolution feature representation; (ii) A semantics branch, with narrow channels and deep layers to obtain high-level semantic context. The detail branch has wide channel dimensions and shallow layers, while the semantics branch has narrow channel dimensions and deep layers. Due to the reduction in the channel capacity and the use of a fast-downsampling strategy, the semantics branch is lightweight and can be implemented by any efficient model. We design a guided aggregation layer to enhance mutual connections and fuse both types of feature representation. Moreover, a booster training strategy is designed to improve the segmentation performance without any extra inference cost. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed architecture shows favorable performance compared to several state-of-the-art real-time semantic segmentation approaches. Specifically, for a $$2048\\times 1024$$input, we achieve 72.6% Mean IoU on the Cityscapes test set with a speed of 156 FPS on one NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti card, which is significantly faster than existing methods, yet we achieve better segmentation accuracy. The code and trained models are available online at https://git.io/BiSeNet.",

      "abstractNote": "Performing collaborative semantic mapping is a critical challenge for multi-robot systems to maintain a comprehensive contextual understanding of the surroundings. In this paper, a novel hierarchical semantic map fusion framework is proposed, where the problem is addressed in low-level single robot semantic mapping and high level global semantic map fusion. In the single robot semantic mapping process, Bayesian rule is used for label fusion and occupancy probability updating, where the semantic information is added to the geometric map grid. High level global semantic map fusion covers decentralized map sharing and global semantic map updating. Collaborative semantic mapping is conducted in two scenarios, that is, NTU dataset and the KITTI dataset. The results show the high quality of the global semantic map, which demonstrates the utility and versatility of 3D semantic map fusion algorithm.",

      "abstractNote": "Implicit neural representations have shown promising potential for the 3D scene reconstruction. Recent work applies it to autonomous 3D reconstruction by learning information gain for view path planning. Effective as it is, the computation of the information gain is expensive, and compared with that using volumetric representations, collision checking using the implicit representation for a 3D point is much slower. In the paper, we propose to 1) leverage a neural network as an implicit function approximator for the information gain field and 2) combine the implicit fine-grained representation with coarse volumetric representations to improve efficiency. Further with the improved efficiency, we propose a novel informative path planning based on a graph-based planner. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in the reconstruction quality and planning efficiency compared with autonomous reconstructions with implicit and explicit representations. We deploy the method on a real UAV and the results show that our method can plan informative views and reconstruct a scene with high quality.",

      "abstractNote": "Despite recent progress of robotic exploration, most methods assume that drift-free localization is available, which is problematic in reality and causes severe distortion of the reconstructed map. In this work, we present a systematic exploration mapping and planning framework that deals with drifted localization, allowing efficient and globally consistent reconstruction. A real-time re-integration-based mapping approach along with a frame pruning mechanism is proposed, which rectifies map distortion effectively when drifted localization is corrected upon detecting loop-closure. Besides, an exploration planning method considering historical viewpoints is presented to enable active loop closing, which promotes a higher opportunity to correct localization errors and further improves the mapping quality. We evaluate both the mapping and planning methods as well as the entire system comprehensively in simulation and real-world experiments, showing their effectiveness in practice. The implementation of the proposed method will be made open-source for the benefit of the robotics community.",

      "abstractNote": "Considering visual localization accuracy at the planning time gives preference to robot motion that can be better localized and thus has the potential of improving vision-based navigation, especially in visually degraded environments. To integrate the knowledge about localization accuracy in motion planning algorithms, a central task is to quantify the amount of information that an image taken at a 6 degree-of-freedom pose brings for localization, which is often represented by the Fisher information. However, computing the Fisher information from a set of sparse landmarks (i.e., a point cloud), which is the most common map for visual localization, is inefﬁcient. This approach scales linearly with the number of landmarks in the environment and does not allow the reuse of the computed Fisher information. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the ﬁrst dedicated map representation for evaluating the Fisher information of 6 degree-of-freedom visual localization for perception-aware motion planning. By formulating the Fisher information and sensor visibility carefully, we are able to separate the rotational invariant component from the Fisher information and store it in a voxel grid, namely the Fisher information ﬁeld. This step only needs to be performed once for a known environment. The Fisher information for arbitrary poses can then be computed from the ﬁeld in constant time, eliminating the need of costly iterating all the 3D landmarks at the planning time. Experimental results show that the proposed Fisher information ﬁeld can be applied to different motion planning algorithms and is at least one order-ofmagnitude faster than using the point cloud directly. Moreover, the proposed map representation is differentiable, resulting in better performance than the point cloud when used in trajectory optimization algorithms.",

      "abstractNote": "In this article, a novel informative autonomous exploration strategy with uniform sampling is proposed to efﬁciently reduce the unknown volume of 3D environments and provide accurate truncated signed distance function (TSDF) based reconstruction for quadrotors. Different from existing methods, the proposed method locally samples candidate viewpoints uniformly and achieves global coverage efﬁciently by backtracking history nodes when there is no unmapped space near the quadrotor. Speciﬁcally, by sampling viewpoints with a ﬁxed radius and assigning priority, the best one is selected to which a collision-free path will be planned. Then, a history list is designed to store the executed nodes, which is backtracked to ﬁnd unmapped space, resulting in complete exploration of the environment. In addition, a hierarchical information gain is proposed to balance the space exploration efﬁciency and reconstruction accuracy by considering the uncertainty of surface and volume of unknown space. Comparative experiments in simulation show that the proposed method outperforms the sampling-based state-of-the-art method in terms of both the exploration time and reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is further evaluated in a real-world experiment.",

      "abstractNote": "This article tackles the problem of active planning to achieve cooperative localization for multirobot systems under measurement uncertainty in GNSS-limited scenarios. Specifically, we address the issue of accurately predicting the probability of a future connection between two robots equipped with range-based measurement devices. Due to the limited range of the equipped sensors, edges in the network connection topology will be created or destroyed as the robots move with respect to one another. Accurately predicting the future existence of an edge, given imperfect state estimation and noisy actuation, is therefore a challenging task. An adaptive power series expansion (or APSE) algorithm is developed based on current estimates and control candidates. Such an algorithm applies the power series expansion formula of the quadratic positive form in a normal distribution. Finite-term approximation is made to realize the computational tractability. Further analyses are presented to show that the truncation error in the finite-term approximation can be theoretically reduced to a desired threshold by adaptively choosing the summation degree of the power series. Several sufficient conditions are rigorously derived as the selection principles. Finally, extensive simulation results and comparisons, with respect to both single and multirobot cases, validate that a formally computed and therefore more accurate probability of future topology can help improve the performance of active planning under uncertainty.",

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous exploration is one of the important parts to achieve the autonomous operation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). To improve the efficiency of the exploration process, a fast and autonomous exploration planner (FAEP) is proposed in this paper. We firstly design a novel frontiers exploration sequence generation method to obtain a more reasonable exploration path, which considers not only the flight-level but frontier-level factors into TSP. According to the exploration sequence and the distribution of frontiers, a two-stage heading planning strategy is proposed to cover more frontiers by heading change during an exploration journey. To improve the stability of path searching, a guided kinodynamic path searching based on a guiding path is devised. In addition, a dynamic start point selection method for replanning is also adopted to increase the fluency of flight. We present sufficient benchmark and real-world experiments. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed exploration planner compared with typical and state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstractNote": "Autonomous exploration in unknown environments is a fundamental task of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). To choose exploration goals wisely, we propose an information-driven exploration strategy by applying the fast marching method to exploration of UAVs. A frontier point detection algorithm is designed to obtain Candidate Goals (CGs) by utilizing the structural characteristics of the octree-based map. With the sum of the information gain during the exploration journey as an evaluation indicator, we present a novel utility function to evaluate CGs by considering the trade-off between information gain and travel consumption. Given the effect of the environment on UAVs, UAVs are required to march aggressively in the Euclidean Symbol Distance Field (ESDF) to calculate the flight time, which is defined as the travel consumption. The uncertainty of the environment is minimized gradually by maximizing the utility function during each exploration journey. To take full advantage of the mobility of UAVs, we perform B-spline trajectory optimization and yaw angle planning based on the fast marching paths. We conduct sufficient comparison and evaluation experiments in simulation environments. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed exploration strategy. The code related to the experiments will be published at https://github.com/BoLeiChen/fastmarching-exploration.",

      "abstractNote": "Gradient-based planners are widely used for quadrotor local planning, in which a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) is crucial for evaluating gradient magnitude and direction. Nevertheless, computing such a ﬁeld has much redundancy since the trajectory optimization procedure only covers a very limited subspace of the ESDF updating range. In this letter, an ESDF-free gradient-based planning framework is proposed, which signiﬁcantly reduces computation time. The main improvement is that the collision term in penalty function is formulated by comparing the colliding trajectory with a collision-free guiding path. The resulting obstacle information will be stored only if the trajectory hits new obstacles, making the planner only extract necessary obstacle information. Then, we lengthen the time allocation if dynamical feasibility is violated. An anisotropic curve ﬁtting algorithm is introduced to adjust higher order derivatives of the trajectory while maintaining the original shape. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments verify its robustness and high-performance. The source code is released as ros packages.",

      "title": "FUEL: Fast UAV Exploration Using Incremental Frontier Structure and Hierarchical Planning",
      "abstractNote": "Autonomous exploration is a fundamental problem for various applications of unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs). Existing methods, however, were demonstrated to insufficient exploration rate, due to the lack of efficient global coverage, conservative motion plans and low decision frequencies. In this letter, we propose FUEL, a hierarchical framework that can support Fast UAV ExpLoration in complex unknown environments. We maintain crucial information in the entire space required by exploration planning by a frontier information structure (FIS), which can be updated incrementally when the space is explored. Supported by the FIS, a hierarchical planner plans exploration motions in three steps, which find efficient global coverage paths, refine a local set of viewpoints and generate minimum-time trajectories in sequence. We present extensive benchmark and real-world tests, in which our method completes the exploration tasks with unprecedented efficiency (3-8 times faster) compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our method will be made open source to benefit the community11To be released at https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FUEL..",

      "title": "RACER: Rapid Collaborative Exploration With a Decentralized Multi-UAV System",
      "abstractNote": "Although the use of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has great potential for fast autonomous exploration, it has received far too little attention. In this article, we present a RApid Collaborative ExploRation (RACER) approach using a fleet of decentralized UAVs. To effectively dispatch the UAVs, a pairwise interaction based on an online hgrid space decomposition is used. It ensures that all UAVs simultaneously explore distinct regions, using only asynchronous and limited communication. Furthermore, we optimize the coverage paths of unknown space and balance the workloads partitioned to each UAV with a capacitated vehicle routing problem formulation. Given the task allocation, each UAV constantly updates the coverage path and incrementally extracts crucial information to support the exploration planning. A hierarchical planner finds exploration paths, refines local viewpoints, and generates minimum-time trajectories in sequence to explore the unknown space agilely and safely. The proposed approach is evaluated extensively, showing high exploration efficiency, scalability, and robustness to limited communication. Furthermore, for the first time, we achieve fully decentralized collaborative exploration with multiple UAVs in the real world. We will release our implementation as an open-source package.",

      "title": "RAPTOR: Robust and Perception-Aware Trajectory Replanning for Quadrotor Fast Flight",
      "abstractNote": "Recent advances in trajectory replanning have enabled quadrotor to navigate autonomously in unknown environments. However, high-speed navigation still remains a significant challenge. Given very limited time, existing methods have no strong guarantee on the feasibility or quality of the solutions. Moreover, most methods do not consider environment perception, which is the key bottleneck to fast flight. In this article, we present RAPTOR, a robust and perception-aware replanning framework to support fast and safe flight, which addresses these issues systematically. A path-guided optimization approach that incorporates multiple topological paths is devised, to ensure finding feasible and high-quality trajectories in very limited time. We also introduce two perception-aware planning approaches to actively observe and avoid unknown obstacles. A risk-aware trajectory refinement ensures that unknown obstacles which may endanger the quadrotor can be observed earlier and avoid in time. The motion of yaw angle is planned to actively explore the surrounding space that is relevant for safe navigation. The proposed methods are tested extensively through benchmark comparisons and challenging indoor and outdoor aggressive flights. We release our implementation as an open-source package1 for the community.",

      "abstractNote": "In this letter, we propose a robust and efficient quadrotor motion planning system for fast flight in three-dimensional complex environments. We adopt a kinodynamic path searching method to find a safe, kinodynamic feasible, and minimum-time initial trajectory in the discretized control space. We improve the smoothness and clearance of the trajectory by a B-spline optimization, which incorporates gradient information from a Euclidean distance field and dynamic constraints efficiently utilizing the convex hull property of B-spline. Finally, by representing the final trajectory as a non-uniform B-spline, an iterative time adjustment method is adopted to guarantee dynamically feasible and non-conservative trajectories. We validate our proposed method in various complex simulational environments. The competence of the method is also validated in challenging real-world tasks. We release our code as an open-source package.",

      "abstractNote": "Gradient-based trajectory optimization (GTO) has gained wide popularity for quadrotor trajectory replanning. However, it suffers from local minima, which is not only fatal to safety but also unfavorable for smooth navigation. In this paper, we propose a replanning method based on GTO addressing this issue systematically. A path-guided optimization (PGO) approach is devised to tackle infeasible local minima, which improves the replanning success rate significantly. A topological path searching algorithm is developed to capture a collection of distinct useful paths in 3-D environments, each of which then guides an independent trajectory optimization. It activates a more comprehensive exploration of the solution space and output superior replanned trajectories. Benchmark evaluation shows that our method outplays state-of-the-art methods regarding replanning success rate and optimality. Challenging experiments of aggressive autonomous flight are presented to demonstrate the robustness of our method. We will release our implementation as an open-source package1.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper proposes a differential ﬂatness-based method for maneuvering a quadrotor so that its position follows a speciﬁed velocity vector ﬁeld. Existing planning and control algorithms often give a 2D or 3D velocity vector ﬁeld to be followed by a robot. However, quadrotors have complex nonlinear dynamics that make vector ﬁeld following difﬁcult, especially in aggressive maneuvering regimes. This paper exploits the differential ﬂatness property of a quadrotor’s dynamics to control its position along a given vector ﬁeld. Differential ﬂatness allows for the analytical derivation of control inputs in order to control the 12D dynamical state of the quadrotor such that the 2D or 3D position of the quadrotor follows the ﬂow speciﬁed by a given vector ﬁeld. The method is derived mathematically, and demonstrated in numerical simulations and in experiments with a quadrotor robot for three different vector ﬁelds.",

      "abstractNote": "Exploration region selection is an essential decision making process in autonomous robot exploration task. While a majority of greedy methods are proposed to deal with this problem, few efforts are made to investigate the importance of predicting long-term planning. In this paper, we present an algorithm that utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn exploration knowledge over office blueprints, which enables the agent to predict a long-term visiting order for unexplored subregions. On the basis of this algorithm, we propose an exploration architecture that integrates a DRL model, a next-best-view (NBV) selection approach and a structural integrity measurement to further improve the exploration performance. At the end of this paper, we evaluate the proposed architecture against other methods on several new office maps, showing that the agent can efficiently explore uncertain regions with a shorter path and smarter behaviors.",

      "abstractNote": "We present a method for efficiently exploring highly convoluted environments. The method incorporates two planning stages - an exploration stage for extending the boundary of the map, and a relocation stage for explicitly transiting the robot to different sub-areas in the environment. The exploration stage develops a local Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) in the free space of the environment, and the relocation stage maintains a global graph through the mapped environment, both are dynamically expanded over replanning steps. The method is compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in various challenging simulation and real environments. Experiment comparisons show that our method is twice as efficient in exploring spaces using less processing than the existing methods. Further, we release a benchmark environment to evaluate exploration algorithms as well as facilitate development of autonomous navigation systems. The benchmark environment and our method are open-sourced.",

      "title": "Online Informative Path Planning for Active Information Gathering of a 3D Surface",
      "abstractNote": "This paper presents an online informative path planning approach for active information gathering on three-dimensional surfaces using aerial robots. Most existing works on surface inspection focus on planning a path offline that can provide full coverage of the surface, which inherently assumes the surface information is uniformly distributed hence ignoring potential spatial correlations of the information field. In this paper, we utilize manifold Gaussian processes (mGPs) with geodesic kernel functions for mapping surface information fields and plan informative paths online in a receding horizon manner. Our approach actively plans information-gathering paths based on recent observations that respect dynamic constraints of the vehicle and a total flight time budget. We provide planning results for simulated temperature modeling for simple and complex 3D surface geometries (a cylinder and an aircraft model). We demonstrate that our informative planning method outperforms traditional approaches such as 3D coverage planning and random exploration, both in reconstruction error and information-theoretic metrics. We also show that by taking spatial correlations of the information field into planning using mGPs, the information gathering efficiency is significantly improved.",

      "abstractNote": "This work presents an embodied agent that can adapt its semantic segmentation network to new indoor environments in a fully autonomous way. Because semantic segmentation networks fail to generalize well to unseen environments, the agent collects images of the new environment which are then used for self-supervised domain adaptation. We formulate this as an informative path planning problem, and present a novel information gain that leverages uncertainty extracted from the semantic model to safely collect relevant data. As domain adaptation progresses, these uncertainties change over time and the rapid learning feedback of our system drives the agent to collect different data. Experiments show that our method adapts to new environments faster and with higher final performance compared to an exploration objective, and can successfully be deployed to real-world environments on physical robots.",
