# Minimum Snap Trajectory Generation

**Why smooth trajectory:**
+ Good for autonomous moving
+ Velocity/higher order dynamics can't change immediately
+ The robot should not stop at turns
+ Save energy

**Why trajectory generation/optimizaton:**
+ Path quality
+ Time efficiency 

## Smooth trajectory generation
+ Boundary condition: start, goal position (orientations)
+ Intermediate condition: waypoint positions (orientations)
	+ found by path finding
+ Smoothness criteria
	+ minimizing rate of change of "input"

## Differential Flatness
