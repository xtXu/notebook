# Soft Constrained Trajectory Optimization
## Motivation
![](../Resource/soft_constrained_trajectory_optimization_img_1.png)
For a vision-based drone:
+ Limited sensing range and quality
+ Noisy depth estimation
Hard-constrained method:
+ Treat all free space equally
+ Solution space is sensitive to noise

## Distance-based Trajectory Optimization
