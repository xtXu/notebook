# Kinodynamic Path Finding
**Kinodynamic : Kinematic + Dynamic
+ Kinematic constraints: avoiding obstacle
+ Dynamic constrains: velocity, acceleration, force
+ **Differentially constrained**
+ **Up to force (acceleration)**

**Why kinodynamic planning?**
+ Coarse-to-fine
+ Trajectory only optimize locally
+ Infeasible path means nothing to nonholonomic system
